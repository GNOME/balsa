	* libbalsa/mailbox.c, src/local-mailbox.c

	Balsa now should read in mailboxes properly.  i.e. check to make sure
	its valid, as well as check its type.  I believe it should load mh
	folders now as well, although I havn't tested this yet, since I don't
	have any mh folders.  Balsa will not open any files with characters
	that are all numbers (i.e. mh messages), nor any files that start with
	a '.'.

	* src/balsa-init.c

	Changed Balsa Init to use a gtk_dialog instead of a gnome_app window.
	I'll probibly change this to a gnome_dialog later.  This should make
	it look a little bit nicer.

	*src/pref-manager.c

	Changed the button box layout to SPREAD instead of END

	* src/balsa-init.c

	More work, should save your settings now.  Mailbox addition inside the
	balsa-init still not there.  Balsa-app now uses balsa-init.c since its
	pretty:)

	* src/balsa-init.c

	Started making balsa-init do something useful.  It is almost complete.  Once
	complete, it will be what is started when Balsa is run for the first time.  It 
	will setup all the information that Balsa needs to run correctly.

        * src/pref-manager.c

	Removed open_main_window() call from pref manager if
	balsa_app.current_index_child was NULL.  This was causing lots of
	opened windows on startup.


Tue Jul 28 04:01:40 1998 Stuart Parmenter <pavlov@innerx.net>

	* TODO, INSTALL, README:

	Update of the documentation (or sad excuse for that).  Added the INSTALL file
	to replace the one thats automagically generated if it doesn't exist.  This
	way we get a file that accually applies to the installation of balsa, and not
	generic stuff.  This should help, not that its hard to do now that c-client is
	removed.

	Updated the TODO file to note that local mailbox dir recursion now is
	implimented but lacks a way to store the mailboxes in something other than a
	list currently.  This will be GForest's use.

	Updated README to remove INSTALL file info, and such.  Added a description,
	etc.

	* src/balsa-init.c
	Started making balsa-init do something useful.  It is almost complete.  Once
	complete, it will be what is started when Balsa is run for the first time.  It 
	will setup all the information that Balsa needs to run correctly.

        * src/pref-manager.c
	Removed open_main_window() call from pref manager if
	balsa_app.current_index_child was NULL.  This was causing lots of
	opened windows on startup.

	* TODO, INSTALL, README:
	Update of the documentation (or sad excuse for that).  Added the INSTALL file
	to replace the one thats automagically generated if it doesn't exist.  This
	way we get a file that accually applies to the installation of balsa, and not
	generic stuff.  This should help, not that its hard to do now that c-client is
	removed.

	Updated the TODO file to note that local mailbox dir recursion now is
	implimented but lacks a way to store the mailboxes in something other than a
	list currently.  This will be GForest's use.

	Updated README to remove INSTALL file info, and such.  Added a description,
	etc.

The following are some general guidelines for adding code to Balsa:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Use FIXME in comments to make a note of things which need looking at.

All GtkObject derivatives should live in there own .c and .h files. In
general functionality should be split in a sensible way amoung files.

respect the libbalsa_ namespace.

commited code should compile with --enable-more-warnings - this
enables some extra warnings and -Werror which makes warnings into
errors.

libmutt
-------

All changes to libmutt/* should be marked with a comment beginning
BALSA: and describing the change and the reason for it.

Source files
------------

All files should have a magic emacs mode line at the top (note older
files will have c-basic-offset as 2):

/* -*-mode:c; c-style:k&r; c-basic-offset:8; -*- */

following this a GPL copyright header. Copyright should be attributed as:

(c) 1997-2000 Stuart Parmenter and others, see AUTHORS for a list of people

Following this should be a brief description of what the file
contains.

See existing source for a general idea.

Coding Style
------------

The coding style used in Balsa currently is a bit of a mess. When
adding a new file to Balsa, please use the standard GNOME indentation
style, rather than the one used in the rest of Balsa. A good place to
read is the file HACKING included with Gnumeric. Maybe at some point
someone will update the existing source.

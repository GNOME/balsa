Build Instructions:

	For more information and configuration options see 'README'.

	# ./configure
	# make

Installation:

	Do the above then

	# make install

Notes:

	Balsa does not play nice with older versions of egcs, if you
	are using an earlier version than 2.95 of this compiler and
	have troubles with segfaults, try compiling with optimizations
	turned off or upgrading.

	You may need to remove your ~/.balsarc file: balsa sometimes
	gets confused when it cannot parse the configuration
	file. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Build Instructions:

	For more information and configuration options see 'README'.

	# ./configure
	# make

Installation:

	Do the above then

	# make install

Notes:

	Balsa does not play nice with older versions of egcs, if you
	are using an earlier version than 2.95 of this compiler and
	have troubles with segfaults, try compiling with optimizations
	turned off or upgrading.

	Some versions of libgnome is known to have bugs that lead to 
	balsa crash on startup. Read
	http://mail.gnome.org/archives/balsa-list/2000-October/msg00101.html
	and make sure you have at least /usr/lib/libgnome.so.32.3.11.

	gcc 2.96 distributed with RedHat 7.0 has problems to compile 
	src/files.c. Use older compilers instead (you may want to try
	CC=kgcc ./configure).

	for links to these packages. Or try http://www.gnome.org,

	Note that some of these modules have their own requirements.
	Installation of pspell is known to be troublesome, make sure 
	you have read - and understood - all the details. Feedback
	should to to pspell team, not balsa team.

	It is highly recommended to install and use the Perl Compatible
	Regular Expression library (PCRE), version 3.0 or higher.
	Further information about this library is available from

	http://www.pcre.org/

	Some pre-built PCRE rpm's can be found at

	http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=pcre

	You need also gnome-doc-tools for building the help system.
	They are available from

	http://people.redhat.com/dcm/software.html

	Since version 2.0.10 balsa has EXPERIMENTAL support for gpg
	signed and encrypted MIME messages according to RFC 3156.
	Further information is available at

	http://www.mynetcologne.de/~nc-dreszal/balsa/balsa23-secure-mail.html

Build Instructions:

	For more information and configuration options see 'README'.
	You need libtool, pspell-devel (obligatory) and
	gnome-print-devel (recommended) packages installed.

	Balsa works also very nicely with gtkhtml >= 0.8 and openldap.

	# ./configure
	# make

Installation:

	Do the above then

	# make install

Notes:

	Balsa does not play nice with older versions of egcs, if you
	are using an earlier version than 2.95 of this compiler and
	have troubles with segfaults, try compiling with optimizations
	turned off or upgrading.

	Some versions of libgnome is known to have bugs that lead to 
	balsa crash on startup. Read
	http://mail.gnome.org/archives/balsa-list/2000-October/msg00101.html
	and make sure you have at least /usr/lib/libgnome.so.32.3.11.

	Experimental gcc 2.96 distributed with RedHat 7.0 generates 
	spurious warning messages. You have to update your compiler 
	(strongly recommended!) or configure balsa with explicitely 
	specified --disable-more-warnings option.

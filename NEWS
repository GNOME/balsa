Balsa-0.9.2 development release. Release date 2000-08-14.
This is a developement release with unfinished features.

There are known problems with POP downloading.

- Is anyone else seeing a crash when deleting the last message from a
mailbox.

If you could also drop in a note about not reporting bugs with GtkHTML
that would be cool (it's only an experimental feature)

You might want to mention especially not to report problems with GtkHTML
not initialising GConf (solution - build GtkHTML without GConf support)

If you experience coredumps or other strange behavior when upgrading
Balsa, try removing ~/.balsarc. The format of the preferences file
has changed and Balsa can get confused if an old one is present.

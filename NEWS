* Balsa-0.9.5 development release. Release date 2000-09-18.

We are in a feature freeze state. The features implemented since 0.9.4
are:

- improved multi-threading.
- new warning/error reporting code.
- LDAP support.
- spell check (pspell package required tu compile and use balsa).
- gnome-config used for storing/reading configuration.
- multiple address book support. vCard- and LDAP-types implemented.
- manual updates
- gnome-print used for printing.

* Balsa-0.9.3 development release. Release date 2000-08-28.

This is a developement release with unfinished features.

POP downloading seem to be finally solved.

Crash when deleting the last message from a mailbox has been identified
and terminated.

Do not report bugs with GtkHTML - it is quite unstable. Patches are
welcome.

If you experience coredumps or other strange behavior when upgrading
Balsa, try removing ~/.balsarc. The format of the preferences file
has changed and Balsa can get confused if an old one is present.

We are trying to improve threading, and merge improved IMAP code
(CRAM-MD5, GSS authentications). If you need these features, drop a
line to balsa-maintaiers@theochem.kth.se, it will give us more
motivation.

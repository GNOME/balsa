Description:
  * Balsa is an e-mail reader.  This client is part of the GNOME
    desktop environment.  It supports local mailboxes, POP3 and
    IMAP.

Configuration:
	Balsa has a lot of options to its configure script; you
should run './configure --help' to get an idea of them. More
complete descriptions are here.

--enable-all
	Will turn on some features that are less than stable,
or unfinsished, such as filtering.

--enable-info
	Enable an information pane displaying the status of
all of your mailboxes in the righthand pane, such as unread
messages, etc. Pretty much broken right now.

--enable-threads
	Compile Balsa with threading for more responsiveness.
This works very well and should be enabled if possible.

--with-website=ROOT
	If specified, generate HTML files for Balsa's website.
This is not necessary unless you wish to mirror Balsa's
website, in which case ROOT is the prefix for all URL's in
the site, defaulting to http://www.balsa.net.

--with-website-prefix=PREFIX
	Specifies where to install the website, if desired;
the website is not installed when not specified.

This uses Mark Crispin's c-client library, which needs to be in or linked from the
toplevel of this directory.  I have left my link in this tar file to show how 
it's done.
 
It must be compiled first in order to compile Balsa.  More information on the
c-client liberary is avaible at http://www.imap.org.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

First compile the c-client library

Then to build balsa:
# cd imap
# make lnx
# cd ..
# ./autogen.sh
# make

FEATURES (not):
  * I can't think of any :-)

That's all for now,
Jay

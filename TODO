Stuart
---------------------------------------------------------
 * bug tigert about getting new icons for toolbar
 * #mh/ requires a .mh_profile in ~ which looks something
   like:  "Path: Mail", telling it to get mh folders from
   ~/Mail
 * if the MAIL env isn't set, the first time balsa is ran
   with a clean ~/.gnome/balsa, the "Default" mailbox isn't
   there, but every time after it is.. look into.
 * lockfile so that Balsa can only be run once.  c-client
   doesn't like like two programms accessing the same
   mailboxes at the same time.


sendmsg-window TODO:
 * look at smtp code crashing if gtk_text is empty

Jay
---------------------------------------------------------
 * clear xmhtml widget when changing mailboxes

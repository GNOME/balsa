      to remember what they are supposed to be doing.

   like:  "Path: Mail", telling it to get mh folders from
   ~/Mail
 * Quote messages in replyto
 * Do not add Re: if one already exists


Jay
---------------------------------------------------------



Someone
---------------------------------------------------------
 * Look into recursing directories upon local mail reading.
   This this should create submenus under the mailbox menu.

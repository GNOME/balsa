TODO LIST:

 * Look into recursing directories upon local mail reading.
   This this should create submenus under the mailbox ctree.

   * Update (07/27/98)
     It now does recursion, but we will need to complete
     gforest to replace the glist that the mailboxes are
     currently stored in.

 * Make an inbox which all external mail sources route mail
   through, which filters then move around as needed.  It
   needs to be possible to set a default folder for external
   sources to be delivered into as well.

 * digest/undigest mail.

Balsa Library (libbalsa):

 * sending mail

Note: This list is not complete, but here for the authors
      to remember what they are supposed to be doing.

 * #mh/ requires a .mh_profile in ~ which looks something
   like:  "Path: Mail", telling it to get mh folders from
   ~/Mail

 * Look into recursing directories upon local mail reading.
   This this should create submenus under the mailbox menu.
   Not sure how to do this right now without chaning lots
   of code, so we will address this later.

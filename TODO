TODO LIST:

For 0.4.5 release:

 * mutt_error - message box
 
 * inbox/outbox/trash should be able to be IMAP

 * fix balsa-init's text box thing



little things:
 * pref manager doesn't save the toolbar type or mdi type
 * make mailbox-conf pretty



later stuff:

 * fix checking for new mail inside mailboxes.
     we have a full mail tray and an empty one.  full should be used to show
     messages with new mail.  the mailbox name should also be in bold.

 * fix it under solaris.  test under aix, hpux, and osf (digital unix i fink?)
     UPDATE: solaris seems to be ok now.  need to test other platforms.

 * digest/undigest mail.

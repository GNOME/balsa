TODO LIST:

post v0.4.5 stuff


little things:
 * make mailbox-conf pretty


later stuff:

 * set cursor for window to GDK_WATCH when we are loading a mailbox so that we
   let the user know we are busy.  use: gdk_cursor_new() and gdk_window_set_cursor()

 * inbox/outbox/trash should be able to be IMAP
    this can be done by editing ~/.balsarc

 * fix checking for new mail inside mailboxes.
     we have a full mail tray and an empty one.  full should be used to show
     messages with new mail.  the mailbox name should also be in bold.

 * fix it under solaris.  test under aix, hpux, and osf (digital unix i fink?)
     UPDATE: solaris seems to be ok now.  need to test other platforms.

 * digest/undigest mail.

 * add mutt keybindings

Nat's ideas:
 * Make it so that clicking on the name of a field in the folder view sorts
   the folder by that field.

 * It is possible to get a context menu off a notebook page/tab thing.
   Make it so that right clicking on a folder tab gives you a context
   menu which gives you the option of closing the folder.

 * In the message composition window, hitting TAB will bring the cursor to
   the next text entry box.  Make it so that hitting ENTER does the same thing.

 * Add a "cancel mail" button to the message composition window.

 * XmHTML doesn't seem to support cutting of text for pasting.  This
   sucks.  Fix it.

 * When you reply to a message, the message is quoted with the '>'
   character.  Make automatic message quoting optional and make it
   flexible enough to allow the user to select their quote
   character(s).

 * A "get new mail" button on the main toolbar would be nice.  It
   should be smart enough to grab POP3 mail if appropriate.

 * An important one: by default, for IMAP and POP mailboxes, Balsa stores the
   user's password in the config file.  The file is mode 0600, however a lot
   of people won't feel so good about this, myself included.  Add an option
   which makes Balsa instead prompt for the password everytime it
   needs to login to the IMAP server.

 * The message display/composition font should be selectable,
   including color.

 * An addressbook fully integrated with the message display; i.e.
   I should be able to click on someone's email address in the message
   and have it pop up the correspondind address book entry, or prompt me
   to create one.  Might want to use Active Tags for this. :-)~

 * It would be nice if the mailboxes in the mailbox list were always
   in some sort of consistent order.

 * It would be nice if the mailbox list had a little more information about
   the mailboxes; e.g. a full tray icon if there are unread messages in
   the mailbox, and an empty tray icon otherwise.

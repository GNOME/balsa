TODO LIST:

For 0.4.5 release:

 * get reply/forward working
     need to convert the message body into text and quote it.  mla is working
     on this.
 
 * mailbox-conf - (is run from right clicking on the mailbox list).  This
   may need to use multiple windows, but I don't really want to do this.
   Adding mailboxes under a folder, should add them to that tree limb, and
   should create the mailbox as a 0 len file if it doesn't already exist.

 * inbox/outbox/trash should be able to be something other than mbox.  Need to
   add support for IMAP, mh or maildir ones.  (mh and/or maildir might work)
 * finish balsa-init so that it will setup your mailboxes correctly.

     UPDATE: this is somewhat working.
             It has inbox, outbox, and trash paths in the balsa-init stuff.
	     This format doesn't allow for IMAP which is something that needed
	     to be done anyways, but I think that this is going to be too
	     confusing (putting all the options in balsa-init).  mailbox-conf
	     sucks right now, and should be updated to work correctly.
     
 * fix checking for new mail inside mailboxes.
     we have a full mail tray and an empty one.  full should be used to show
     messages with new mail.  the mailbox name should also be in bold.

 * get pref-manager working with gnome-propertybox
    UPDATE: this works.  setting the toolbar type doesn't save.. hmm




later stuff:

 * fix it under solaris.  test under aix, hpux, and osf (digital unix i fink?)
     UPDATE: solaris seems to be ok now.  need to test other platforms.

 * digest/undigest mail.

 * add mutt keybindings

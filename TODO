TODO LIST:

---------------------------------------------------------
Note: This list is not complete, but here for the authors
      to remember what they are supposed to be doing.
---------------------------------------------------------



Stuart
---------------------------------------------------------
 * Save the choice of text/icons/both for the toolbar.
 * #mh/ requires a .mh_profile in ~ which looks something
   like:  "Path: Mail", telling it to get mh folders from
   ~/Mail
 * if the MAIL env isn't set, the first time balsa is ran
   with a clean ~/.gnome/balsa, the "Default" mailbox isn't
   there, but every time after it is.. look into.
 * lockfile so that Balsa can only be run once.  c-client
   doesn't like like two programms accessing the same
   mailboxes at the same time.

sendmsg-window TODO:
 * look at smtp code crashing if gtk_text is empty
-- need to check 4-29-98


Jay
---------------------------------------------------------
 * clear xmhtml widget when changing mailboxes
 * delete messages
 * more stuff goes here...



Someone
---------------------------------------------------------
 * Look into recursing directories upon local mail reading.
   This this should create submenus under the mailbox menu.
   Not sure how to do this right now without chaning lots
   of code, so we will address this later.

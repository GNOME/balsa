TODO LIST:

 * Look into recursing directories upon local mail reading.
   This this should create submenus under the mailbox ctree.

 * Make an inbox which all external mail sources route mail
   through, which filters then move around as needed.  It
   needs to be possible to set a default folder for external
   sources to be delivered into as well.

Balsa Library (libbalsa):

 * Start with a mbox parser that puts everything into the
   correct structures, etc.  Messages need to store the
   starting and ending offsets for their messages, as well
   as mime parts need to store their offsets in the body_list
   inside the message structure.

 * mh folders, maildir, etc etc etc... same as above.

 * Steal RCS's time parser.  Josh says its really awsome. :)

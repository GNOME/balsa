----------------------------------
Old list.. may or may not be in above list

 * inbox/outbox/trash should be able to be IMAP
    this can be done by editing ~/.balsarc

 * digest/undigest mail.

 * add mutt keybindings

Nat's ideas:
 * It is possible to get a context menu off a notebook page/tab thing.
   Make it so that right clicking on a folder tab gives you a context
   menu which gives you the option of closing the folder.

 * In the message composition window, hitting TAB will bring the cursor to
   the next text entry box.  Make it so that hitting ENTER does the same thing.

 * The message display/composition font should be selectable,
   including color.

 * An addressbook fully integrated with the message display; i.e.
   I should be able to click on someone's email address in the message
   and have it pop up the correspondind address book entry, or prompt me
   to create one.  Might want to use Active Tags for this. :-)~

 * It would be nice if the mailboxes in the mailbox list were always
   in some sort of consistent order.


Jeff's ideas:
 * Scan local folders periodically for new mail delivered and sorted
   by procmail

 * Auto-enable procmail features if a procmailrc is present

 * Export filter rules in procmail format

 * Various modes for folder update:  local sync with remote, local only,
   remote only (with caching).

 * Auto-download and use of IMAP "folder map" instead of manually
   creating and binding each Balsa mailbox obj to a remote box

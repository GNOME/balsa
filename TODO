Things needed for Balsa v0.5 (for GNOME 1.0 release)
Fix/update/make-sure-they-work:
 * POP3
 * IMAP
 * balsa-init

New features/unfinished things:
 * Filters
 * CORBA
 * update libmutt

UI:
 D Mailbox list in the main window (as a handle.. should be reparentable)
 * finish move and copy
 * put deleted items in the trash and remove them from the current clist
 * mailboxes with new mail should have bold text
 P DND (drag and drop)
 * MIME supporting icons.  use the new gnome metadata stuff that gmc uses?
 * Use useful sounds
 * New mail notification
     P via sound
     * change icon window incase Balsa is minimized to a different icon
 * sending mail (code is awful, redo.  make useful for corba idl, support
     external editors)
 * auto-open mailboxes on startup
 * Make things optional:
     - inline images (on by default)
     - check for new mail ever xx minutes
     - open mailboxes on startup
     - load mail from local mail directory
 * spell checking in the send window


----------------------------------
Old list.. may or may not be in above list

 * inbox/outbox/trash should be able to be IMAP
    this can be done by editing ~/.balsarc

 * digest/undigest mail.

 * add mutt keybindings

Nat's ideas:
 * It is possible to get a context menu off a notebook page/tab thing.
   Make it so that right clicking on a folder tab gives you a context
   menu which gives you the option of closing the folder.

 * In the message composition window, hitting TAB will bring the cursor to
   the next text entry box.  Make it so that hitting ENTER does the same thing.

 * The message display/composition font should be selectable,
   including color.

 * An addressbook fully integrated with the message display; i.e.
   I should be able to click on someone's email address in the message
   and have it pop up the correspondind address book entry, or prompt me
   to create one.  Might want to use Active Tags for this. :-)~

 * It would be nice if the mailboxes in the mailbox list were always
   in some sort of consistent order.

TODO LIST:

 * spell checking in the send window

 * inbox/outbox/trash should be able to be IMAP
    this can be done by editing ~/.balsarc

 * fix checking for new mail inside mailboxes.
     The mailbox name should be in bold.

 * digest/undigest mail.

 * add mutt keybindings

Nat's ideas:
 * It is possible to get a context menu off a notebook page/tab thing.
   Make it so that right clicking on a folder tab gives you a context
   menu which gives you the option of closing the folder.

 * In the message composition window, hitting TAB will bring the cursor to
   the next text entry box.  Make it so that hitting ENTER does the same thing.

 * Add a "cancel mail" button to the message composition window.

 * XmHTML doesn't seem to support cutting of text for pasting.  This
   sucks.  Fix it.

 * When you reply to a message, the message is quoted with the '>'
   character.  Make automatic message quoting optional and make it
   flexible enough to allow the user to select their quote
   character(s).

 * The message display/composition font should be selectable,
   including color.

 * An addressbook fully integrated with the message display; i.e.
   I should be able to click on someone's email address in the message
   and have it pop up the correspondind address book entry, or prompt me
   to create one.  Might want to use Active Tags for this. :-)~

 * It would be nice if the mailboxes in the mailbox list were always
   in some sort of consistent order.

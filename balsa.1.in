.SH NAME
Balsa \- the GNOME e-mail client.
.SH DESCRIPTION
You can use Balsa to fetch, read, write and send e-mails.
.PP
It supports
  * local mailboxes in maildir, mbox and/or mh format,
  * nested mailboxes,
  * protocols POP3, IMAP and SMTP,
  * multithreaded mail retrieval,
  * GnuPG/GPG encryption, LDAP, Kerberos and SSL,
  * MIME (view images, save parts),
  * multiple character sets,
  * vCard, GPE, and other address book formats,
  * printing and spell-checking.
.PP
Balsa is an integral part of the GNOME desktop environment, but it can
also be used standalone though it may print some error messages then.
.PP
For help on using Balsa, see the documentation in its help menu using
the Yelp Gnome help/documentation browser.
.PP
This man page tells about the options of the '\fBbalsa\fR' command,
which is used to start Balsa.
.PP
Most of these options let you tell Balsa that when it starts
it should immediately open a mailbox, or the composer,
and things like that.
.PP
When you start Balsa from the command line,
not only can you use the command line options described below,
any error messages are printed to that terminal too
(whether you execute that command in the background or not).

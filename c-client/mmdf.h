/*
 * What?  You want to understand the VALID macro anyway?  Alright, since you
 * insist.  Actually, it isn't really all that difficult, provided that you
 * take it step by step.
 *
 * Line 1	Initializes the return ti value to failure (0);
 * Lines 2-3	Validates that the 1st-5th characters are ``From ''.
 * Lines 4-5	Validates that there is an end of line and points x at it.
 * Lines 6-13	First checks to see if the line is at least 41 characters long.
 *		If so, it scans backwards to find the rightmost space.  From
 *		that point, it scans backwards to see if the string matches
 *		`` remote from''.  If so, it sets x to point to the space at
 *		the start of the string.
 * Line 14	Makes sure that there are at least 27 characters in the line.
 * Lines 15-20	Checks if the date/time ends with the year (there is a space
 *		five characters back).  If there is a colon three characters
 *		further back, there is no timezone field, so zn is set to 0
 *		and ti is set in front of the year.  Otherwise, there must
 *		either to be a space four characters back for a three-letter
 *		timezone, or a space six characters back followed by a + or -
 *		for a numeric timezone; in either case, zn and ti become the
 *		offset of the space immediately before it.
 * Lines 21-23	Are the failure case for line 14.  If there is a space four
 *		characters back, it is a three-letter timezone; there must be a
 *		space for the year nine characters back.  zn is the zone
 *		offset; ti is the offset of the space.
 * Lines 24-27	Are the failure case for line 20.  If there is a space six
 *		characters back, it is a numeric timezone; there must be a
 *		space eleven characters back and a + or - five characters back.
 *		zn is the zone offset; ti is the offset of the space.
 * Line 28-31	If ti is valid, make sure that the string before ti is of the
 *		form www mmm dd hh:mm or www mmm dd hh:mm:ss, otherwise
 *		invalidate ti.  There must be a colon three characters back
 *		and a space six or nine	characters back (depending upon
 *		whether or not the character six characters back is a colon).
 *		There must be a space three characters further back (in front
 *		of the day), one seven characters back (in front of the month),
 *		and one eleven characters back (in front of the day of week).
 *		ti is set to be the offset of the space before the time.
 *
 * Why a macro?  It gets invoked a *lot* in a tight loop.  On some of the
 * newer pipelined machines it is faster being open-coded than it would be if
 * subroutines are called.
 *
 * Why does it scan backwards from the end of the line, instead of doing the
 * much easier forward scan?  There is no deterministic way to parse the
 * ``user'' field, because it may contain unquoted spaces!  Yes, I tested it to
 * see if unquoted spaces were possible.  They are, and I've encountered enough
 * evil mail to be totally unwilling to trust that ``it will never happen''.

      <title>POP</title>
      <p>An acronym for “Post Office Protocol”, a simple method of
      retrieving mail messages from a remote mail server. Widely
      used by mail clients from an Internet Service Provider's mail
      server to a user's machine for viewing. Currently most people
      use version three of the protocol, otherwise known as POP3. A
      very simple protocol, and not very flexible, but simple to
      implement and ubiquitous throughout the internet.</p>

      <title>IMAP</title>
      <p>An acronym that stands for “Internet Mail Access
      Protocol”. It is a newer method of accessing mail over the
      internet. It is far more featureful than &POP3;, allowing
      for remote folders on the mail server, and more control over
      mail delivery. However it is not as widely supported.</p>

      is also known as a Local Delivery Agent (LDA). It is
      responsible for delivering the mail recieved for someone on a
      machine to the mail folder of that person. &procmail; is
      an example of this type of program, although many
      <link xref="glossary#mta">MTA</link>'s have their own
      MDA implementations.</p>

      <p>An acronym for “Mail Transfer Agent”, this class of
      program is responsible for moving mail around between people,
      be they on the same computer, on on completely separate
      networks. Examples of this type of program include

      would use to read existing mail and create new messages. MUAs
      are one of three types of programs that allow internet email
      to work. The other two types of programs are
      <link xref="glossary#mta">MTA</link> s and
      <link xref="glossary#mda">MDA</link> s. &Balsa; is
      primarily an MUA, but it also functions as an MDA/MTA when
      retrieving mail from a remote server.</p>

      <title>Regular Expression</title>
      <p>Often abbreviated as a

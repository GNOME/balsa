  <title>It's not Working!!!</title>
  <p>This is a FAQ for when &Balsa; appears to lock up, or
  other things that you think should be happening aren't. If you
  can't figure out how to do something but &Balsa; lets you do
  it, that's a bug. Report it.</p>

    <p>Odds are it isn't. Watch out for:</p>

        <p>If you don't have threading, &Balsa; will stop
        responding when it sends and receives email. Use threading,
        if possible.</p>

        <p>&Balsa; is downloading a new message or closing a
        large mailbox. This could take a while, especially when
        this file is accessed via NFS.</p>

        <p>A dialog box is being displayed but it is obscured by
        another one. This seems to happen under Sawfish. Try moving
        the windows around and see if there's a hidden dialog
        somewhere.</p>

    <title>What's that window that flashed on the screen?</title>
    <p>Were you checking your mail? Probably. This is the window
    that displays progress for retrieving &POP3; mail. If you
    don't have any &POP3; accounts, it will still appear -- but
    it'll disappear almost instantly. You can disable displaying
    this window in preferences.</p>

    <p>&Balsa; attempts to open the file
    <file>~/.gnome/GnomeCard.gcrd</file>. If you're not using this
    file, you may need to create a symlink so that &Balsa; can
    open it.</p>
    <p>There have been slight changes in &GnomeCard;'s file
    format between its various versions. &Balsa; is known to
    work with at least &GnomeCard; version 1.0.10 and probably
    most other releases.</p>

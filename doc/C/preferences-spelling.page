  <title>Spell Check Preferences</title>
  <p>If &Balsa; is using GtkSpell, you can choose to have your
  spelling checked as you type. &Balsa; uses GtkSpell's default
  settings.</p>
  <p>If &Balsa; is not using GtkSpell, you can use this pane to
  setup &Balsa; spell check options. &Balsa; uses the
  Portable Spell Checking library
  (<link href="http://pspell.sourceforge.net">pspell</link>) to
  provide an interface to the spell checking program of your
  choice. Currently there are modules for ispell or aspell, both of
  which can be found at the pspell website. For more information
  visit the &Balsa; homepage.</p>

        <gui>Pspell Module</gui>
      </title>
      <p>The Pspell library allows you to use whatever spell
      checking engine you prefer, though the use of loadable
      modules. Currently Pspell has support for two modules, the
      traditional ispell, and the newer and more advanced
      aspell.</p>
      <p>
      <app>Ispell</app> is most likely available on your system as
      it is a Unix standard; however
      <app>Aspell</app> is more advanced as it uses an advanced
      phonetics engine and adaptive techniques to learn how you
      tend to misspell words. More information is available at the
      <link href="http://aspell.sourceforge.net">Aspell
      website</link>.</p>
      <p>&Balsa; will attempt to use whatever module you
      specify here, however if the module is not installed it will
      not work and generate an error.</p>

        <gui>Suggestion Mode</gui>
      </title>
      <p>The suggestion mode determines how hard the computer will
      search for suggestions for misspelled words. There are three
      options:</p>

            <gui>Fast</gui>
          </title>
          <p>This mode quickly scans for replacements, which means
          it might be used by a good speller who occasionally makes
          typographical errors.</p>

          <title>
            <gui>Normal</gui>
          </title>
          <p>The Normal mode is probably good enough for most
          people; it should produce the correct suggestion in the
          majority of cases.</p>

            <gui>Bad Spellers</gui>
          </title>
          <p>The Bad Spellers mode is the most thorough and
          accurate mode; however, it also takes the longest to find
          a list of suggestions.</p>

        <gui>Ignore Length</gui>
      </title>
      <p>This provides the ability to ignore words shorter than a
      certain length. It may be useful to automatically skip short
      acronyms that are normally flagged as incorrect.</p>

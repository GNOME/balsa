      <para>Balsa is a graphical mail client. While it is still in 
      active development, Balsa has many features such as: IMAP and
      POP3 support; sendmail or direct SMTP support; optional 
      multithreaded retrieval and sending of messages; support for all
      configurations of local mail folders; automatic mail checking;
      mail printing; inline attachment viewing; and the proverbial
      much, much more.

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Balsa is a graphical mail client similar to Eudora on
    Windows. It supports the standard features of any good reader and
    has new features added continually.</para>

    <para>Balsa is written using GTK+ and Gnome. It is based on libmutt,
    the backend code to Mutt, but expands far beyond being a graphical
    Mutt. Balsa supports: IMAP and POP3 accounts; sending mail via 
    sendmail or direct SMTP; optional multithreaded mail retrieval and
    sending; support for all configurations of local mail folders; 
    automatic mail checking; mail printing; inline attachment viewing;
    and the proverbial much, much more.</para>

    <para>If you want to learn more about Balsa, your best bet is the
    mailling list <email>balsa-list@gnome.org</email>, which can be 
    subscribed to by sending a message with a subject of subscribe to
    <email>balsa-list-request@gnome.org</email>. Bugs can be reported
    via <application>bug-buddy</application>, <application>gnome-bug
    </application> or to <email>submit@bugs.gnome.org</email>.</para>

    <title>Getting Started with Balsa</title>

    <para>If you're starting Balsa for the first time, the first thing
    you'll see is a druid that will set up Balsa's basic settings. Balsa
    can guess most of what it needs to know about you. It will also 
    create five standard local mailboxes: the Inbox, Outbox, Sentbox, Draftbox,
    and Trash. (These can be changed to be IMAP or POP3 mailboxes 
    later.)</para>

    <para>There are many more settings in Balsa's 
    <link linkend="deadend">preferences window</link>, but most of
    them do not need to be changed.</para>

    <para>Once Balsa is configured, you will proceed on to the 
    <link linkend="win-main">main window</link>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="win-main">
    <title>The Main Window</title>

    <para>Balsa's main window has three major areas. To the left is the
    mailbox list. This displays all the mailboxes Balsa knows about; it will
    scan for ones in your local mail directory. (This means Balsa works well
    with <application>procmail</application>.) It will also list IMAP or
    POP3 mailboxes that you have configured.</para>

    <para>At the top-right is a notebook view of all the currently open
    mailboxes. You can browse messages, manipulate them, and switch between
    open mailboxes here.</para>

    <para>At the bottom-right of Balsa's main window is the message view. This
    displays the message selected in the message listing. You can save attachments,
    view attachments, and read incoming email here.</para>

    <sect2 id="subwin-mblist">
       <title>The Mailbox List</title>

       <para>The mailbox list in the main window lists all of your mailboxes.
       Balsa will automatically detect your local mailboxes by searching
       for mailboxes under your local mail directory (probably ~/mail). This
       lets Balsa coexist with <application>pine</application> and
       <application>procmail</application> well.</para>
  
       <para>Your mailboxes will be displayed as a tree view, with mailboxes
       in subdirectories of your local mail directory initially hidden but
       accessible by expanding the tree. POP3 and IMAP mailboxes will also
       be displayed as being at the top level of the tree.</para>

    with Balsa.</para>

    <sect2 id="ct-create-new-mb">
      <title>Creating New Mailboxes</title>

      <para>You can create new local and IMAP mailboxes by right-clicking in
      the mailbox list and selecting New Mailbox. This will start a dialog that
      will let you name the mailbox and specify its location.</para>

      <para>To create a new POP3 mailbox, go to the configuration dialog, select
      the Mailboxes section, and click Add in the POP3 area. A dialog will be
      displayed that will let you set up the new mailbox. (Note: under Sawmill, this
      dialog may be obscured, causing the appearance that Balsa has locked up. Move
      the configuration dialog and see if the new dialog was hidden.) The mailbox
      may not appear in the list immediately, or in the current session of Balsa at
      all, but it exists. Yes, this is a bug.</para>

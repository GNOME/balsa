    <abstract>
      <para>Balsa is a graphical mail client. While it is still in 
      active development, Balsa has many features such as: IMAP and
      POP3 support; sendmail or direct SMTP support; optional 
      multithreaded retrieval and sending of messages; support for all
      configurations of local mail folders; automatic mail checking;
      mail printing; inline attachment viewing; and the proverbial
      much, much more.

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Balsa is a graphical mail client similar to Eudora on
    Windows. It supports the standard features of any good reader and
    has new features added continually.</para>

    <para>Balsa is written using GTK+ and Gnome. It is based on libmutt,
    the backend code to Mutt, but expands far beyond being a graphical
    Mutt. Balsa supports: IMAP and POP3 accounts; sending mail via 
    sendmail or direct SMTP; optional multithreaded mail retrieval and
    sending; support for all configurations of local mail folders; 
    automatic mail checking; mail printing; inline attachment viewing;
    and the proverbial much, much more.</para>

    <para>If you want to learn more about Balsa, your best bet is the
    mailling list <email>balsa-list@gnome.org</email>, which can be 
    subscribed to by sending a message with a subject of subscribe to
    <email>balsa-list-request@gnome.org</email>. Bugs can be reported
    via <application>bug-buddy</application>, <application>gnome-bug
    </application> or to <email>submit@bugs.gnome.org</email>.</para>

    <title>Getting Started with Balsa</title>

    <para>If you're starting Balsa for the first time, the first thing
    you'll see is a druid that will set up Balsa's basic settings. Balsa
    can guess most of what it needs to know about you. It will also 
    create five standard local mailboxes: the Inbox, Outbox, Sentbox, Draftbox,
    and Trash. (These can be changed to be IMAP or POP3 mailboxes 
    later.)</para>

    <para>There are many more settings in Balsa's 
    <link linkend="deadend">preferences window</link>, but most of
    them do not need to be changed.</para>

    <para>Once Balsa is configured, you will proceed on to the 
    <link linkend="win-main">main window</link>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="win-main">
    <title>The Main Window</title>

    <para>Balsa's main window has three major areas. To the left is the
    mailbox list. This displays all the mailboxes Balsa knows about; it will
    scan for ones in your local mail directory. (This means Balsa works well
    with <application>procmail</application>.) It will also list IMAP or
    POP3 mailboxes that you have configured.</para>

    <para>At the top-right is a notebook view of all the currently open
    mailboxes. You can browse messages, manipulate them, and switch between
    open mailboxes here.</para>

    <para>At the bottom-right of Balsa's main window is the message view. This
    displays the message selected in the message listing. You can save attachments,
    view attachments, and read incoming email here.</para>

    <sect2 id="subwin-mblist">
       <title>The Mailbox List</title>

       <para>The mailbox list in the main window lists all of your mailboxes.
       Balsa will automatically detect your local mailboxes by searching
       for mailboxes under your local mail directory (probably ~/mail). This
       lets Balsa coexist with <application>pine</application> and
       <application>procmail</application> well.</para>
  
       <para>Your mailboxes will be displayed as a tree view, with mailboxes
       in subdirectories of your local mail directory initially hidden but
       accessible by expanding the tree. POP3 and IMAP mailboxes will also
       be displayed as being at the top level of the tree.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="subwin-msgindex">
      <title>The Message Index</title>

      <para>The message index displays the messages in the current folder,
      and lets you choose which folder's messages to view. Click on the
      notebook tabs, or double-click on a folder in the 
      <link linkend="subwin-mblist">mailbox list</link> to bring it to the
      front.</para>
 
      <para>From the message index you can do a lot. Clicking on a message
      will cause it to be displayed in the message view. Right-clicking on
      it will give a popup menu letting you reply to the message (or forward
      it, etc.) and move it to another folder (using the Transfer menu item).
      Double-clicking on a message will open it in a separate window.</para>

      <para>There are some useful hotkeys for the message index.</para>

    <para>This section explains many of the things you might want to do
    with Balsa.</para>

    <sect2 id="ct-create-new-mb">
      <title>Creating New Mailboxes</title>

      <para>You can create new local and IMAP mailboxes by right-clicking in
      the mailbox list and selecting New Mailbox. This will start a dialog that
      will let you name the mailbox and specify its location.</para>

      <para>To create a new POP3 mailbox, go to the configuration dialog, select
      the Mailboxes section, and click Add in the POP3 area. A dialog will be
      displayed that will let you set up the new mailbox.</para>

      <note><para>Under Sawmill, this
      dialog may be obscured, causing the appearance that Balsa has locked up. Move
      the configuration dialog and see if the new dialog was hidden.</para></note> 

      <note><para>The mailbox
      may not appear in the list immediately, or in the current session of Balsa at
      all, but it exists. Yes, this is a bug.</para></note>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="ct-move-msg">
      <title>Moving Messages</title>

      <para>The easiest way to move messages around is to select them in the
        <link linkend="subwin-msgindex">message index</link> and use the Transfer
        context menu. It will let you choose a mailbox in the 
        <link linkend="subwin-mblist">mailbox list</link> and the messages will
        be moved there. (Moving messages to the current folder used to be a coredump
        but is now a noop)</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="ct-main-folder-imap">
      <title>I want one of the main folders to be IMAP</title>

      <para>This can be done. It's ugly, but possible.</para>

      <para>First, create the IMAP folder as you want it configured. It will appear as
      something like &quot;INBOX on host.domain.org&quot;. Exit Balsa. (I told you this
      was bad.)</para>
 
      <para>Open up ~/.balsarc in your favorite editor. There will be a visible organization
      to the file; find the place called &quot;Accounts&quot;. There will be at least five
      definitions that look like &quot;Inbox = {Type = local;Name = (etc.)&quot;. There will
      also be one that says something like &quot;m1 = {Type = IMAP;Name = (etc.)&quot;. Edit
      the file to replace &quot;m1&quot; (or whatever number) with &quot;Inbox&quot;, and
      it would be wise to change the &quot;Name&quot; field to &quot;Inbox&quot;. Change the
      Inbox entry to be the opposite; Inbox becomes m1 and Name becomes Local Inbox (for
      example).</para>

      <para>Close the .balsarc and restart <application>Balsa</application>. Your Inbox
      will now be an IMAP mailbox. Hopefully you can figure out how to make your other mailboxes
      IMAP-based from these instructions.</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="its-not-working">
    <title>It's not Working!!!</title>

    <para>This is a FAQ for when Balsa appears to lock up, or other things
    that you think should be happening aren't. If you can't figure out how
    to do something but Balsa lets you do it, that's a bug. Report it</para>

        when it sends and receives email. Use threading, if possible.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>Balsa is opening or closing a large mailbox. This could
        take a while, especially when this file is accessed via NFS.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>A dialog box is being displayed but it is obscured by
        another one. This seems to happen under Sawmill. Try moving the windows
        around and see if there's a hidden dialog somewhere.</para></listitem>

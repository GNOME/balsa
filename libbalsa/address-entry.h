/*
 * A structure that describes an e-mail entry.  That is, it contains
 * the user input, and the alias expansian of ONE e-mail entry.
 *
 * user  is the user's input.  This is a character string.  If this
 *       contains an '@', '%' or '!', we won't expand.
 *       @ for smtp, and ! for uucp.  There are no leading spaces,
 *       but there can be trailing spaces if the user pressed 'space'.
 *
 * match is the current match to the user's input.  If this is NULL,
 *       there is no match.
 *
 * cursor is the last known cursor position in the input.  It is
 *        offset from the first character in the input, and may
 *        not exceed the length of the input.
 *        -1 is cursor not set.
 *
 * tabs is the number of tab keys pressed.  In essence, this is the
 *      nth match of the user input.

 * \param pattern key search pattern (e.g. name, fingerprint, ...), may be NULL to list all keys
 * \param secret TRUE to search for private keys, FALSE to search for public keys
 * \param on_keyserver TRUE to search on a key server, FALSE to search the local key ring
 * \param error filled with error information on error, may be NULL
 * \return TRUE on success, or FALSE if any error occurred
 *
 * Use the passed context to search for keys matching the passed criteria.  Note that even if the function returns success, the
 * list of keys may be empty if no matching key could be found.
 *
 * \note Listing external (key server) keys for a fingerprint longer than 16 hex characters fails, so be sure to cut them
 *       appropriately when calling this function with \em on_keyserver == TRUE.\n
 *       The returned list of keys shall be freed by the caller.
 * \todo We might want to add flags for returning only keys which have the is_qualified (subkey can be used for qualified
 *       signatures according to local government regulations) and/or is_de_vs (complies with the rules for classified information
 *       in Germany at the restricted level, VS-NfD, requires gpgme >= 1.9.0) properties set.

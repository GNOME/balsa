/** \brief Extract a single VCard 4.0
 *
 * \param stream VCard input stream
 * \param eos filled with TRUE is the end of the input stream has been reached
 * \param error filled with error information on error
 * \return a new address object on success
 *
 * Read a VCard from the input stream and extract all relevant fields into a LibBalsaAddress.  A LibBalsaAddress is returned only if
 * it contains any email address.  The caller shall distinguish this case from an error by checking if the error argument is filled.
 * The input stream is positioned immediately after the card read.
 *
 * \note The caller shall unref the returned address object.

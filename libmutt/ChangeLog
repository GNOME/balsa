	* pgpkey.c: Minor nit: if you enter the wrong key

	hung there. (From Liviu Daia.)

Wed Aug 26 21:12:23 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* rfc822.c: Another possible memory leak in
	rfc822_parse_adrlist.  The problem and the patch
	are pretty much the same as with the last fix
	applied to this file - it's just ',' instaed of
	';' this time.

	* rfc822.c, TODO:
	[patch-0.94.4i.tlr.rfc822_leak.1] Fixing a memory leak in
	the rfc822_parse_adrlist().

	Some explanations seem to be in order here.  Let's look at
	the code:

	   386	    else if (*s == ';')
	   387	    {
	   388	      if (phraselen)
	   389	      {
	   390		phrase[phraselen] = 0;
	   391		add_addrspec (&top, &last, phrase, comment, &commentlen, sizeof (comment) - 1);
	   392	      }
	   393	      else if (commentlen && !last->personal)
	   394	      {
	   395		comment[commentlen] = 0;
	   396		last->personal = safe_strdup (comment);
	   397	      }
	   398	#ifdef EXACT_ADDRESS
	   399	      if (last && !last->val)

	Line 399 contains the change; previously, it looked like
	this:

	   399'       if (last)

	   400		last->val = mutt_substrdup (begin, s);
	   401	#endif
	   402
	   403	      /* add group terminator */
	   404	      cur = rfc822_new_address ();
	   405	      if (last)
	   406	      {
	   407		last->next = cur;
	   408		last = cur;
	   409	      }
	   410
	   411	      phraselen = 0;
	   412	      commentlen = 0;
	   413	      s++;
	   414	      begin = s;
	   415	      SKIPWS (begin);
	   416	    }

	OK, what happens? There are essentially two situations here:

	-> We have already parsed a complete address specification
	   and know about this fact, but there was no new address
	   information.  This is the case if we are parsing
	   through addresses like

		undisclosed-recipients:;

	   or

		recipients: a, b, c,;

	   (Note the extra ',' before the ';'!)

	   In this case, some of the other code in rfc822.c has
	   already filled in last->val, and we really shouldn't
	   overwrite that with a NULL pointer.

	-> The ';' finishes an address spec, like in

		recipients: a;

	   In this case, last is either set by add_addrspec(), or
	   it has already been set by some of the previous code
	   (comment handling, ...).  Anyway, last->val is still
	   NULL, so it is correct to write the complete addr spec
	   to last->val.

	* imap.c: Error message cosmetics.

Thu Aug 20 22:32:46 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* sendlib.c, recvattach.c, parse.c, mutt.h,
	mime.h, lib.c, handler.c, globals.h, compose.c,
	commands.c, attach.c, Attic/BUGS:
	[patch-0.94.3.bl.other_types.1] This patch adds
	support for the model MIME type.  Additionally,
	along the lines of "strict in what you generate,
	accepting in what you receive", this patch will
	keep the name of major mime types it doesn't
	recognize (instead of using x-unknown).

	* compose.c, Attic/BUGS:
	[patch-0.94.3i.jmy.attachmessage-fix.1] This patch
	fixes a bug in the allocation of space for new
	pointers to the attachments, it would make mutt
	seg-fault when attaching 5 or more messages at the
	same time. (From: Jimmy M√§kel√§
	<jmy@flashback.net>)

	* handler.c: [SECURITY] mutt_sanitize_filename()
	should be called when creating temporary files for
	autoview.  (From: Liviu Daia.)

	* sendlib.c, send.c, attach.c: Try this: set
	$mime_forward, forward a PGP-encrypted message,
	then in the "compose" menu try to view the
	forwarded message. If you didn't enter a
	passphrase before, Mutt won't ask for it either.
	(From: Liviu Daia)

	* sendlib.c, attach.c: When you forward a message
	with $mime_forward set, or when you attach a
	message with the "attach-message" command from the
	"compose" menu, there is a memory leak.  The real
	reason for this leak is that multipart attachments
	are not supported in the "compose" menu, so you
	need to go through quite a few contortions in
	order to handle message/rfc822 attachments.
	Consequently, the patch below is just an ugly
	hack.  (From: Liviu Daia)

Sun Aug 16 06:22:51 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* rfc822.c: Bringing 128-byte strings to "STRING".

	* recvattach.c, Attic/BUGS:
	[patch-0.94.3i.tlr.attach_msg_fmt.1] When parsing
	the "%d" format option in the attachment format,
	use the message format as a fall-back if no
	explicit description is provided.  This fixes the
	following bug:

	  set mime_forward. Forward any mesage. The
	  compose menu will show the description as
	  "Forwarded message from ...." which is fine.
	  Pressing 'd' to edit the description brings up
	  the above string for editing.

	  Now hit Enter on the message/rfc822 attachment
	  to view it. Quit out of the pager.

	  The description field has now changed to the
	  Subject: of the forwarded message. Pressing 'd'
	  still brings up the 'Forwarded message from....'
	  string.

	(Noted by Vikas.)

	* doc/manual.txt, doc/manual.sgml, sendlib.c,
	mutt.h, init.h: [patch-0.94.3i.tlr.write_bcc.1]
	This patch adds an option $write_bcc which
	controls whether the Bcc header is written out or
	not.  This can be used to work around broken MTA's

	The problem was noted independently by Peter
	Radcliffe <pir@pir.net> and by Dave Holland

	* rfc2047.c: Fixing a stupid buffer overflow plus some flawed logic.

	* functions.h, compose.c, OPS:
	Adding an update-encoding function to the compose menu.
	This is useful if the user has externally modified an

	Also, this patch fixes some redraw-related problems in the

	* bind.c: Removing bind.c.  Pointed out by Gero Treuner
	<gero@faveve.uni-stuttgart.de>.

Sun Aug  9 18:43:45 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* color.c: With SLang, init_pair is (void), so we must not check its
	return value.

	* color.c: Restructuring color.c.  This patch fixes the "default"
	problem from 0.94.2i and makes the code more
	comprehensible than that version and more consie than
	0.94.1i.

Sat Aug  8 21:40:12 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* rfc2047.c: Fixing the "=?" detection in rfc2047_encode_string().  Bug
	noted by David Jeske <jeske@home.chat.net>.

	* compose.c: If you press t to add a recipient in the compose menu,
	then press tab, q, and aborts with ctrl-g, mutt won't
	redraw the menu.  Noted by Jimmy M√§kel√§
	<jmy@flashback.net>.

	* alias.c: Entering an un-parsable address when creating an alias
	would make mutt segfault.  Noted by brian moore
	<bem@cmc.net>.

	* browser.c: If you press tab in the file-browser to see the inboxes
	and the current row is greater than the inbox-screens
	max-rows then the screen gets garbled.
	(From: Jimmy M√§kel√§ <jmy@flashback.net>)

	* doc/manual.txt, doc/manual.sgml: I made the manual more up to date:

	* new version
	* new mailing list and home page addresses
	* made the terminology a bit more consistent regarding
	  'pattern' and 'regular expression'
	* added a note about expanding UNIX environments
	* added a note about <, >, in range patterns like ~m
	* added a note about the urlview program
	* changed tables to not use tabs, because it doesn't work
	  right in my favourite web browsers lynx and netscape

	(From: Gero Treuner <gero@faveve.uni-stuttgart.de>)

	* pattern.c: This patch makes pattern ranges more logical. Before '~m
	<5' would show message 1-5, with this patch it shows 1-4.
	Inclusive ranges is still avaible if you use '~m -5'.
	(From: Jimmy M√§kel√§ <jmy@flashback.net>)

	* init.c: Various improvements to the mutt_command_complete
	function.  From Stephen Hack <shack@rsn.hp.com>.

	* browser.c: If you specify 'mailboxes ""' mutt will seg-fault. (From:
	Jimmy M√§kel√§ <jmy@flashback.net>)

	* color.c: Fixing a memory leak.  Thanks, Liviu.

	* commands.c: When printing a message, headers are now sorted according
	to hdr_order.  From Liviu.

	* browser.c: Fixing an off-by-one buffer overflow in browser.c.  Noted
	by Liviu.

	* lib.c, attach.c: This patch adds some more "safe" characters to
	mutt_sanitize_filename and fixes its usage in
	mutt_view_attachment().  (From: Liviu Daia
	<daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

	* status.c, sort.h, sendlib.c, send.c, query.c, protos.h, postpone.c, pager.h, pager.c, mutt_menu.h, menu.c, main.c, init.c, headers.c, functions.h, curs_main.c, curs_lib.c, compose.c, commands.c, browser.c, addrbook.c, OPS:
	Adding the attach message patch.  From Vikas Agnihotri
	<VikasA@att.com>.

	* Makefile.in: There is no "compile" rule for dotlock in the Makefile.
	(From: Dan Nelson <dnelson@emsphone.com>)

	* imap.c: Thispatch to imap.c allows the user to specify a port
	number in the folder name in the general form
	{hostname:portnum}foldername. (From: Andy Sloane
	<andude@guildsoftware.com>)

	* imap.c: imap_close_connection() was being called even though the
	client was using mulitple mailboxes over the same
	connection.  (From: Brandon Long <blong@fiction.net>)


Fri Jul 31 08:17:50 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* rfc1524.c: Changing an sprintf to an snprintf (which it was meant to
	be.)

	* protos.h: mutt_sanitize_filename takes char *, not const char *.

	* protos.h, lib.c, attach.c:
	Introducing mutt_sanitize_filename().  The code is similar
	to patch-0.91.1i.tlr.rfc1524_sanitize.1 and to Peter
	Holzer's patch against 0.91.

	* rfc1524.h, rfc1524.c, postpone.c, attach.c:
	Avoid possible buffer overflows in mutt_adv_mktemp().

	* sendlib.c: Interpret sysexits-style exit values from sendmail.

	* configure.in, configure, config.h.in, acconfig.h:
	Check for sysexits.h.

Thu Jul 30 09:30:38 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* edit.c: When reading in files, be_snarf_file() wouldn't recognize
	'~' as the user's home directory.

Wed Jul 29 10:54:09 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* README, Changes: Finalizing 0.93.2i.

	* configure.in, configure: Bumping to 0.93.2(i).

	* parse.c: Fixing a buffer overflow in parse.c which presented a
	serious security thread.  Noted by Paul Boehm
	<paul@boehm.org>.

Tue Jul 28 08:21:49 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* Attic/patch.slang-1.2.2.keypad.1: Adding a patch for a SLang bug.

	* INSTALL: Adding a patch for a SLang bug.

	* mx.c: Doing 'mutt -f NoSuchFile' just flickers the screen and
	silently exits. Earlier (0.92.14 at least), it used to
	spit out the error 'NoSuchFile: no such file or directory
	(errno = 2)'.  (Noted and tracked down by Vikas Agnihotri
	<VikasA@att.com>)

	* color.c: The index cache should be updated even without color
	support.

Mon Jul 27 13:39:39 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* Attic/BUGS: Adding a notice about some more nits.

	* main.c: Change the error reporting mail address from
	<mutt-dev@cs.hmc.edu> to <mutt-dev@mutt.org>.

	* protos.h, init.h, color.c:
	This patch fixes index "color" patterns when using a
	non-color capable curses library.  While working on color
	support, I've thrown together the mutt_parse_color() and
	mutt_parse_mono() functions as they are sharing most of
	their code.  Additionally, a new directive called "unmono"
	is introduced.  The implementation consists in adding a
	flag and very few lines of code (plus ifdefs) to
	mutt_parse_uncolor().

	* snprintf.c, rfc1524.h, rfc1524.c, date.c:
	Fixing some minor nits: missing #includes in date.c and
	snprintf.c, and a not-so-nice declaration of
	rfc1524_new_entry().  Noted by Digital cc and gcc.

Fri Jul 24 08:12:46 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* copy.c, attach.c:
	Fiddling around with message/rfc822 attachments once again.

Thu Jul 23 20:57:50 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* status.c, sendlib.c, send.c, rfc2047.c, pop.c, pager.c, mx.c, mh.c, mbox.c, lib.c, init.c, imap.c, edit.c, curs_lib.c, compose.c, commands.c, color.c, browser.c, attach.c, alias.c:
	Guard lots of global (char *) variable deferences against
	NULL pointers.

	* copy.c, attach.c:
	Yet another patch about saving message/rfc822 attachments.

	* main.c, send.c: Fixing potential NULL pointer deferences.

Wed Jul 22 22:47:57 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* recvattach.c: Another fix from Liviu.

	* recvattach.c, from.c, attach.c:
	Another patch from liviu to fix the message/rfc822
	behaviour.

	* recvattach.c, mx.c, attach.c:
	This patch fixes the saving of message/rfc822 attachments
	to mail folders.  Additionally, it fixes an outstanding
	bug with From_ lines being written to MH folders.

	(From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

	* menu.c, functions.h, browser.c, OPS:
	1. When I hit 'c' (change dir) in browser, it gives me the
	   directory, but without the final '/', so I have to add
	   '/' to add a subdirectory name. This patch fixes it.

	2. check-new now will recheck mailbox folders for new
	   mail.

	3. added a function toggle-mailboxes which toggles in
	   browser between mailboxes view and directory view.
	   (bound to TAB by default).

	(From: "Michael S. Tsirkin" <mtsirkin@iil.intel.com>)

	* send.c: Correct an error message in send.c.
	(From: Byrial Jensen <byrial@post3.tele.dk>)

	* sendlib.c, recvattach.c, protos.h, postpone.c,
	pager.c, mx.c, mutt.h, lib.c, keymap.c, handler.c,
	compose.c, commands.c, attach.h, attach.c:

	These changes fix some of the bugs which were
	recently reported to mutt-dev.  To be more specific,
	message-type attachments are saved to mail folders
	from the receive attachment menu, some of the
	sending code has been made more robust against
	disappearing attachments, and "tag" is rebound to
	"T" on the compose menu.

	(Some part of this patch comes from Vikas Agnihotri
	<VikasA@att.com>.)

	* send.c: Avoid a potential segmentation fault when
	trying to postpone, but Postponed equals NULL.

	* Attic/BUGS: This file is intended to contain known
	bugs which still have to be fixed.

	* doc/manual.txt:
	Committing the changes previously made to manual.sgml.

	* imap.c: Include Message-ID and Reply-To headers
	when fetching a message's headers from an IMAP
	server. (From: Andy Sloane <andude@incarnate.net>)

Tue Jul 21 07:54:03 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* recvattach.c:
	The old behaviour of the %d (for description) specifier is
	recreated by this patch.
	(From: Byrial Jensen <byrial@post3.tele.dk>)

	* protos.h, lib.c, attach.c:
	You should never _ever_ do something like this:

	       [process A]  ---[piped write until EOF]---> [process B]
	       [process A]  <---[piped read until EOF]--- [process B]

	Basically, what happens is something like this: A
	feeds data to B; B processes the data, and feeds it
	to the pipe until the pipe buffer is full; at this
	point, A writes to its pipe until its buffer is full
	too, and if it still has more data to write, that's
	it, it never gets to the read part to flush B's
	buffer --- both processes are blocked on write.

	This patch fixes such a situation in the compose menu.

	(From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

Mon Jul 20 21:01:05 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* reap.pl: Perl lies in /usr/bin on my machines.

	* pop.c: It seems that if you don't enter any
	password at all when prompted for the POP password,
	Mutt will die with a segmentation fault also. (Bug
	reported by Steve Mayer <smayer@rtd.com> via the
	Debian bug tracking system, fix from Thomas
	Roessler.)

	* postpone.c: When you send a message which have
	been postponed before sending, then all its
	attachments (if there are more than one) will have a
	content-disposition header which includes a
	filename, even if there isn't a real filename but
	only random choosen temporary one. (From: Byrial
	Jensen <byrial@post3.tele.dk>)

Sat Jul 18 09:18:31 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* recvattach.c: "Set mime_forward, and forward a
	message --- Mutt will segfault." The obvious fix for
	this is to check for aptr->content->hdr in
	mutt_attach_fmt() before invoking
	_mutt_make_string().  Anyway, I suspect that the
	real fix may involve something like parsing the
	rfc822 attachment in question.

	* sendlib.c: Postponing messages behaves funny when the $postponed
	folder is in Maildir format; I traced this down to the
	fact that postponed messages are saved in "cur" while
	mutt_num_postponed() is looking at "new".
	(From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

Fri Jul 17 08:37:02 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* compose.c: Removing the old snd_entry() code.

	* doc/manual.sgml, protos.h, pgp.c, mutt.h, init.h, hook.c:
	When sending encrypted messages, it may arrive that Mutt
	can't determine the PGP key of the recipient (presumably
	because her address has changed, but she hasn't updated
	her PGP key yet). In this situation it's convenient to be
	able to associate a keyID with an address automatically.
	The attached patch is an attempt to implement this idea
	using a "pgp-hook". (From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>).

	* recvattach.c: Removing the old attach_entry() code.

	* recvattach.c, protos.h, mutt.h, init.h, globals.h, compose.c:
	This patch adds a string variable $attach_format which
	controls the look of the compose and attach menus.
	Unfortunately, I was not able to make things so that it
	would look exactly the same as the hardcoded versions, so
	the default format is a bit different, but I think it is
	quite usable.  (From Michael Elkins <me@cs.hmc.edu>).

	* functions.h, browser.c, OPS:
	This patch allows you to view files from the browser
	window, useful if you are searching for a file to attach
	to your message. It uses the standard mailcap stuff (and
	the lookup mime types) to use the correct "viewer" for the
	file.  (From Brandon Long <blong@fiction.net>)

	* doc/Attic/dotlock.man.in, doc/Makefile.in, configure.in, configure, Makefile.in:
	Dotlock-related changes: We call it mutt.dotlock to avoid
	conflicts with certain NFS versions' dotlocking utilities
	(pointed out by Liviu Daia).  Additionally, we need to
	compile it as an external utility on systems which don't
	have an fchdir(2) system call.

Thu Jul 16 16:39:53 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* mx.c: Fixing a small typographic error.

	* mx.c: Mutt doesn't retry locking if it doesn't succeed at once.
	The code in mx_lock_file is supposed to retry but it
	doesn't work because of a mistake in operator precedence.
	(From: Petri Kaukasoina <kaukasoi@elektroni.ee.tut.fi>)

	* Attic/dotlock.c:
	The dotlock.c file tries to include <posix1_lim.h> if
	_POSIX_PATH_MAX isn't defined but it doesn't include
	<limits.h>, where this symbol should be defined.  (From
	Marc.Baudoin@solsoft.com)

	* send.c: When several messages are tagged and the user applies
	reply, group-reply, or list-reply to these messages, the
	reply's references and in-reply-to headers are constructed
	from the tagged message which comes last in the current
	index.  This patch constructs the references header from
	_all_ messages' message-id and references headers. (tlr)

	* reldate.h, configure.in, configure, Changes, ChangeLog:
	Preparing mutt 0.94.

	* imap.c: "My two remaining issues are the speed at which it
	downloads the headers, and support of PREAUTH. I'm
	enclosing a patch (to stock mutt-0.92.13i) which addresses
	these issues." (From Brian Marcotte
	<marcotte@panix7.panix.com>)

	* color.c: This patch fixes two problems reported on mutt-users.

	(1) the error message about "default colors not supported"
	when not using a color xterm should not be printed.  The
	existing code did not check the value of has_colors() in
	conjunction with use_default_colors()

	(2) mutt would crash when sending mail in batch mode
	because use_default_colors() could be used without doing
	an initscr()

	(From Michael Elkins.)

Wed Jul 15 17:15:46 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* mx.h, mx.c, main.c, Attic/dotlock.h,
	Attic/dotlock.c, configure.in, configure,
	Makefile.in: Finalizing the external dotlock
	support: If group mail privileges are needed, the
	dotlock is compiled as a separate program.  If
	there is no need for privileges, it remains a
	module which is compiled into mutt. Also, there is
	no more need for the SLang buffer overflow
	work-around in main().  We drop it, but let mutt
	bail out instead if it's installed setgid
	something.

	* doc/Attic/dotlock.man.in, Attic/dotlock.c:
	Fix the race condition in dotlock.c.

	* doc/Attic/mutt.man.in:

	* Attic/dotlock.h:
	file dotlock.h was initially added on branch mutt-0-94.

	* Attic/dotlock.c:
	Adding external dotlocking.  For bugs, see the manual page
	and the comments in dotlock.c.

	* Attic/dotlock.c:
	file dotlock.c was initially added on branch mutt-0-94.

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.in:
	Adding external dotlocking.  For bugs, see the manual page
	and the comments in dotlock.c.

	* doc/mutt.man: More roff fixes.

	* doc/mutt.man: More groff fixes.

Tue Jul 14 16:01:07 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* reldate.h, configure.in, configure, Changes, ChangeLog:
	Preparing mutt 0.93.1i.

	* rfc2047.c, mime.h, handler.c: More unsigned fixes.

	* pattern.c, parse.c:
	Changing (int) casts in is* arguments to (unsigned char).

	* rfc2047.c: Removing a superfluous (unsigned char) cast in an IsPrint
	argument.

Mon Jul 13 10:50:39 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* doc/mutt.sgml, doc/mutt.man, doc/Makefile.in:
	Since manual page generation seems to be broken in the
	SGML-tools package, we remove the SGML version of mutt.man
	and make the troff source the master copy.  Suggested by
	Roland Rosenfeld <roland@luv.rhein.de> who also provided
	the corrected mutt.man file.

Sun Jul 12 13:15:31 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* protos.h: Replace calloc by safe_calloc in new_pattern.

	* NEWS: s/fwd_decode/forward_decode/ (Noted by Lars Hecking)

	* pop.c: tmp[] wasn't initialized when asking for the POP password.

	* buffy.c: On SunOS 4.1, one must include unistd.h in order to

	wouldn't be displayed.

Thu Jul  9 19:51:36 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* configure.in, configure, Attic/config.sub:

	Changing (int) casts in is* arguments to (unsigned char)
	casts to avoid mis-casting of signed chars.  (From Michael
	Elkins.)

	* doc/manual.txt, doc/manual.sgml: Documenting $hidden_host.

	* thread.c, curs_main.c: Fix "previous-subthread"
	in reverse-threads mode, allow next-(sub)thread
	and previous-(sub)thread to work in limited mode.
	(From: Liviu Daia)

Sun Aug 23 10:05:41 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* sendlib.c, send.c, protos.h, mutt.h, main.c,
	init.h, init.c, configure.in, configure,
	config.h.in, alias.c, acconfig.h, INSTALL:
	[patch-0.94.3i.tlr.hidden_host.1] Replace the
	--enable-hidden-host configure switch by a
	configuration variable $hidden_host which can be
	changed at run-time. This variable will _not_
	affect the generation of message-IDs since we'll
	get into uniqueness problems if we just use the
	domain here.

	Needs to be documented.

	* doc/manual.txt: Committing the latest manual
	changes.

	* Attic/socket.c, imap.c:
	[patch-0.94.3.bl.imap_buffy.1-2] Fixing the
	buffered read stuff.

	* Attic/mutt_socket.h: Ups, this one was missing
	from Brandon's IMAP patch.

Sat Aug 22 14:24:18 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* help.c: [patch-0.94.3i.gt.beautify_help.1.gz]
	General help beautification.  From Gero Treuner.

	* doc/manual.sgml, keymap.h, keymap.c, help.c,
	Muttrc.in: [patch-0.94.3i.gt.description.1]
	Introduce macro descriptions.

	* doc/manual.sgml, init.h, init.c, browser.c: Add
	a negation operator "!" to $mask's syntax (as in
	the *-hooks).  From Liviu.

	* recvattach.c: Make Vikas' attach_split and
	Brandon's other_type patches fit together.

	* recvattach.c, mutt.h, init.h, globals.h,
	compose.c: [patch-0.94.3.vikas.attach_split.3]
	Re-introduce attach_split.

	* Attic/socket.c: [patch-0.94.3.bl.imap_buffy.1]
	Adding Brandon's IMAP buffy support.

	* mx.c, mutt.h, mailbox.h, imap.h, imap.c,
	curs_lib.c, configure.in, configure, buffy.c,
	browser.c, Attic/BUGS:
	[patch-0.94.3.bl.imap_buffy.1] Adding Brandon's
	IMAP buffy support.

Fri Aug 21 08:17:09 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* browser.c: Enter the file browser, type a mask
	which doesn't match any file in the current
	directory, clean the mask. Segfault.  Fix from
	Liviu Daia.

Thu Aug 20 22:32:46 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* sendlib.c, recvattach.c, parse.c, mutt.h,
	mime.h, lib.c, handler.c, globals.h, compose.c,
	commands.c, attach.c, Attic/BUGS:
	[patch-0.94.3.bl.other_types.1] This patch adds
	support for the model MIME type.  Additionally,
	along the lines of "strict in what you generate,
	accepting in what you receive", this patch will
	keep the name of major mime types it doesn't
	recognize (instead of using x-unknown).

	* compose.c, Attic/BUGS:
	[patch-0.94.3i.jmy.attachmessage-fix.1] This patch
	fixes a bug in the allocation of space for new
	pointers to the attachments, it would make mutt
	seg-fault when attaching 5 or more messages at the
	same time. (From: Jimmy Mäkelä
	<jmy@flashback.net>)

	* handler.c: [SECURITY] mutt_sanitize_filename()
	should be called when creating temporary files for
	autoview.  (From: Liviu Daia.)

	* sendlib.c, send.c, attach.c: Try this: set
	$mime_forward, forward a PGP-encrypted message,
	then in the "compose" menu try to view the
	forwarded message. If you didn't enter a
	passphrase before, Mutt won't ask for it either.
	(From: Liviu Daia)

	* sendlib.c, attach.c: When you forward a message
	with $mime_forward set, or when you attach a
	message with the "attach-message" command from the
	"compose" menu, there is a memory leak.  The real
	reason for this leak is that multipart attachments
	are not supported in the "compose" menu, so you
	need to go through quite a few contortions in
	order to handle message/rfc822 attachments.
	Consequently, the patch below is just an ugly
	hack.  (From: Liviu Daia)

Sun Aug 16 06:22:51 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* rfc822.c: Bringing 128-byte strings to "STRING".

	* sendlib.c: Use add_option, not add_arg, for
	strings such as "--".

	* sendlib.c: Pass an "--" argument to sendmail
	before the address arguments, so addresses with a
	leading dash don't lead to problems. (From Liviu.)

	* sendlib.c, rfc822.c, rfc1524.c, parse.c, mx.c,
	main.c, lib.c, keymap.c, hash.c, handler.c,
	edit.c, curs_lib.c, alias.c: Replacing a bunch of
	free() and malloc() calls by safe_free() and
	safe_malloc().  (From Liviu.)

Sat Aug 15 18:27:45 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* imap.c: read() can't read buffers larger than
	SSIZE_MAX.

	* hook.c: [patch-0.94.3i.tlr.empty_hook.1] Ignore
	empty hooks instead of segfaulting.

	* protos.h, init.c, Attic/history.h:
	[patch-0.94.3i.tlr.history.1] Adding history class
	support.

	* Attic/history.c: [patch-0.94.3i.tlr.history.1]
	Adding history class support.

	* enter.c, TODO, Makefile.in:
	[patch-0.94.3i.tlr.history.1] Adding history class
	support.

	* sendlib.c:
	[patch-0.94.3i.tlr.attach_msg_fmt.1-2] When
	generating a message/rfc822 type attachment, parse
	its header so that the attachment format routines
	can properly display the default description.

	* init.h: Change attach_format's default to limit
	the attachment description's length.

Thu Aug 13 22:09:16 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* pgppubring.c: Fixing another memory leak in the
	pubring parser.

	* recvattach.c, Attic/BUGS:
	[patch-0.94.3i.tlr.attach_msg_fmt.1] When parsing
	the "%d" format option in the attachment format,
	use the message format as a fall-back if no
	explicit description is provided.  This fixes the
	following bug:

	  set mime_forward. Forward any mesage. The
	  compose menu will show the description as
	  "Forwarded message from ...." which is fine.
	  Pressing 'd' to edit the description brings up
	  the above string for editing.

	  Now hit Enter on the message/rfc822 attachment
	  to view it. Quit out of the pager.

	  The description field has now changed to the
	  Subject: of the forwarded message. Pressing 'd'
	  still brings up the 'Forwarded message from....'
	  string.

	(Noted by Vikas.)

	* doc/manual.txt, doc/manual.sgml, sendlib.c,
	mutt.h, init.h: [patch-0.94.3i.tlr.write_bcc.1]
	This patch adds an option $write_bcc which
	controls whether the Bcc header is written out or
	not.  This can be used to work around broken MTA's
	(Exim seems to leave Bcc headers in).

	The problem was noted independently by Peter
	Radcliffe <pir@pir.net> and by Dave Holland
	<dave@zenda.demon.co.uk> (Debian Bug #25687).

	* pgppubring.c: [patch-0.94.3i.tlr.pubring_leak.1]
	Fixing a memory leak. Bug noted by Liviu Daia.

	* reldate.h: 0.94.3i.

	* configure.in, configure, ChangeLog: Preparing
	0.94.3i.

	* compose.c: indentation cosmetics.

	* compose.c: Update menu->data when OP_COMPOSE_EDIT_HDRS is called.
	From Vikas.

	* compose.c: Update the encoding after using ispell from the compose
	menu.  From Vikas.

	* sendlib.c, send.c, protos.h, pgppubring.c,
	pattern.c, lib.c, curs_main.c, compose.c,
	attach.c: Various nits from Liviu; encoding fixes.

	* rfc822.c: Fixing a buffer overflow in rfc822_cat().  tmplen could
	underflow.

Wed Aug 12 11:50:59 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* init.c: Yet another memory leak fix from Liviu.

	* rfc2047.c: Fixing a stupid buffer overflow plus some flawed logic.

	* functions.h, compose.c, OPS:
	Adding an update-encoding function to the compose menu.
	This is useful if the user has externally modified an
	attachment and _wants_ to adjust the encoding afterwards.
	Also, this patch fixes some redraw-related problems in the
	compose menu.

	* sendlib.c, mutt.h, compose.c, Attic/BUGS:
	When changing or deleting attachments, the compose menu
	now notices this and complains or asks accordingly.
	Partially from Vikas.

Tue Aug 11 08:14:38 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* Attic/BUGS: Yet another outstanding bug.

	* doc/manual.txt: This now contains the latest changes to manual.sgml.

	* sendlib.c, rfc2047.c, rfc1524.c, pgppubring.c, pager.c, hdrline.c:
	Fixing various nits noted by Liviu and his colleagues.

Mon Aug 10 15:30:02 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* sendlib.c: This patches makes the message-id persistant when
	postponing messages.  (From: Janos Farkas)

	* doc/manual.sgml, sample.muttrc, lib.c, init.h:
	This patch introduces "unhdr_order" to reset the hdr_order
	command's effect.  (From: Janos Farkas)

	* color.c: Drop the free_rx parameter from muitt_free_color_line(),
	as it's always 1.

	* color.c: Adding mutt_free_color_line() and replacing varous
	"manual" free()s of color lines by calls to this function.

	* bind.c: Removing bind.c.  Pointed out by Gero Treuner
	<gero@faveve.uni-stuttgart.de>.

Sun Aug  9 18:43:45 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* color.c: With SLang, init_pair is (void), so we must not check its
	return value.

	* color.c: Restructuring color.c.  This patch fixes the "default"
	problem from 0.94.2i and makes the code more
	comprehensible than that version and more consie than
	0.94.1i.

Sat Aug  8 21:40:12 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* rfc2047.c: Fixing the "=?" detection in rfc2047_encode_string().  Bug
	noted by David Jeske <jeske@home.chat.net>.

	* compose.c: If you press t to add a recipient in the compose menu,
	then press tab, q, and aborts with ctrl-g, mutt won't
	redraw the menu.  Noted by Jimmy Mäkelä
	<jmy@flashback.net>.

	* alias.c: Entering an un-parsable address when creating an alias
	would make mutt segfault.  Noted by brian moore
	<bem@cmc.net>.

	* browser.c: If you press tab in the file-browser to see the inboxes
	and the current row is greater than the inbox-screens
	max-rows then the screen gets garbled.
	(From: Jimmy Mäkelä <jmy@flashback.net>)

	* doc/manual.txt, doc/manual.sgml: I made the manual more up to date:

	* new version
	* new mailing list and home page addresses
	* made the terminology a bit more consistent regarding
	  'pattern' and 'regular expression'
	* added a note about expanding UNIX environments
	* added a note about <, >, in range patterns like ~m
	* added a note about the urlview program
	* changed tables to not use tabs, because it doesn't work
	  right in my favourite web browsers lynx and netscape

	(From: Gero Treuner <gero@faveve.uni-stuttgart.de>)

	* pattern.c: This patch makes pattern ranges more logical. Before '~m
	<5' would show message 1-5, with this patch it shows 1-4.
	Inclusive ranges is still avaible if you use '~m -5'.
	(From: Jimmy Mäkelä <jmy@flashback.net>)

	* init.c: Various improvements to the mutt_command_complete
	function.  From Stephen Hack <shack@rsn.hp.com>.

	* browser.c: If you specify 'mailboxes ""' mutt will seg-fault. (From:
	Jimmy Mäkelä <jmy@flashback.net>)

	* color.c: Fixing a memory leak.  Thanks, Liviu.

	* commands.c: When printing a message, headers are now sorted according
	to hdr_order.  From Liviu.

	* browser.c: Fixing an off-by-one buffer overflow in browser.c.  Noted
	by Liviu.

	* lib.c, attach.c: This patch adds some more "safe" characters to
	mutt_sanitize_filename and fixes its usage in
	mutt_view_attachment().  (From: Liviu Daia
	<daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

	* status.c, sort.h, sendlib.c, send.c, query.c, protos.h, postpone.c, pager.h, pager.c, mutt_menu.h, menu.c, main.c, init.c, headers.c, functions.h, curs_main.c, curs_lib.c, compose.c, commands.c, browser.c, addrbook.c, OPS:
	Adding the attach message patch.  From Vikas Agnihotri
	<VikasA@att.com>.

	* Makefile.in: There is no "compile" rule for dotlock in the Makefile.
	(From: Dan Nelson <dnelson@emsphone.com>)

	* imap.c: Thispatch to imap.c allows the user to specify a port
	number in the folder name in the general form
	{hostname:portnum}foldername. (From: Andy Sloane
	<andude@guildsoftware.com>)

	* imap.c: imap_close_connection() was being called even though the
	client was using mulitple mailboxes over the same
	connection.  (From: Brandon Long <blong@fiction.net>)


Fri Jul 31 08:17:50 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* rfc1524.c: Changing an sprintf to an snprintf (which it was meant to
	be.)

	* protos.h: mutt_sanitize_filename takes char *, not const char *.

	* protos.h, lib.c, attach.c:
	Introducing mutt_sanitize_filename().  The code is similar
	to patch-0.91.1i.tlr.rfc1524_sanitize.1 and to Peter
	Holzer's patch against 0.91.

	* rfc1524.h, rfc1524.c, postpone.c, attach.c:
	Avoid possible buffer overflows in mutt_adv_mktemp().

	* sendlib.c: Interpret sysexits-style exit values from sendmail.

	* configure.in, configure, config.h.in, acconfig.h:
	Check for sysexits.h.

Thu Jul 30 09:30:38 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* edit.c: When reading in files, be_snarf_file() wouldn't recognize
	'~' as the user's home directory.

Wed Jul 29 10:54:09 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* README, Changes: Finalizing 0.93.2i.

	* configure.in, configure: Bumping to 0.93.2(i).

	* parse.c: Fixing a buffer overflow in parse.c which presented a
	serious security thread.  Noted by Paul Boehm
	<paul@boehm.org>.

Tue Jul 28 08:21:49 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* Attic/patch.slang-1.2.2.keypad.1: Adding a patch for a SLang bug.

	* INSTALL: Adding a patch for a SLang bug.

	* mx.c: Doing 'mutt -f NoSuchFile' just flickers the screen and
	silently exits. Earlier (0.92.14 at least), it used to
	spit out the error 'NoSuchFile: no such file or directory
	(errno = 2)'.  (Noted and tracked down by Vikas Agnihotri
	<VikasA@att.com>)

	* color.c: The index cache should be updated even without color
	support.

Mon Jul 27 13:39:39 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* Attic/BUGS: Adding a notice about some more nits.

	* main.c: Change the error reporting mail address from
	<mutt-dev@cs.hmc.edu> to <mutt-dev@mutt.org>.

	* protos.h, init.h, color.c:
	This patch fixes index "color" patterns when using a
	non-color capable curses library.  While working on color
	support, I've thrown together the mutt_parse_color() and
	mutt_parse_mono() functions as they are sharing most of
	their code.  Additionally, a new directive called "unmono"
	is introduced.  The implementation consists in adding a
	flag and very few lines of code (plus ifdefs) to
	mutt_parse_uncolor().

	* snprintf.c, rfc1524.h, rfc1524.c, date.c:
	Fixing some minor nits: missing #includes in date.c and
	snprintf.c, and a not-so-nice declaration of
	rfc1524_new_entry().  Noted by Digital cc and gcc.

Fri Jul 24 08:12:46 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* copy.c, attach.c:
	Fiddling around with message/rfc822 attachments once again.

Thu Jul 23 20:57:50 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* status.c, sendlib.c, send.c, rfc2047.c, pop.c, pager.c, mx.c, mh.c, mbox.c, lib.c, init.c, imap.c, edit.c, curs_lib.c, compose.c, commands.c, color.c, browser.c, attach.c, alias.c:
	Guard lots of global (char *) variable deferences against
	NULL pointers.

	* copy.c, attach.c:
	Yet another patch about saving message/rfc822 attachments.

	* main.c, send.c: Fixing potential NULL pointer deferences.

Wed Jul 22 22:47:57 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* recvattach.c: Another fix from Liviu.

	* recvattach.c, from.c, attach.c:
	Another patch from liviu to fix the message/rfc822
	behaviour.

	* recvattach.c, mx.c, attach.c:
	This patch fixes the saving of message/rfc822 attachments
	to mail folders.  Additionally, it fixes an outstanding
	bug with From_ lines being written to MH folders.

	(From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

	* menu.c, functions.h, browser.c, OPS:
	1. When I hit 'c' (change dir) in browser, it gives me the
	   directory, but without the final '/', so I have to add
	   '/' to add a subdirectory name. This patch fixes it.

	2. check-new now will recheck mailbox folders for new
	   mail.

	3. added a function toggle-mailboxes which toggles in
	   browser between mailboxes view and directory view.
	   (bound to TAB by default).

	(From: "Michael S. Tsirkin" <mtsirkin@iil.intel.com>)

	* send.c: Correct an error message in send.c.
	(From: Byrial Jensen <byrial@post3.tele.dk>)

	* sendlib.c, recvattach.c, protos.h, postpone.c,
	pager.c, mx.c, mutt.h, lib.c, keymap.c, handler.c,
	compose.c, commands.c, attach.h, attach.c:

	These changes fix some of the bugs which were
	recently reported to mutt-dev.  To be more specific,
	message-type attachments are saved to mail folders
	from the receive attachment menu, some of the
	sending code has been made more robust against
	disappearing attachments, and "tag" is rebound to
	"T" on the compose menu.

	(Some part of this patch comes from Vikas Agnihotri
	<VikasA@att.com>.)

	* send.c: Avoid a potential segmentation fault when
	trying to postpone, but Postponed equals NULL.

	* Attic/BUGS: This file is intended to contain known
	bugs which still have to be fixed.

	* doc/manual.txt:
	Committing the changes previously made to manual.sgml.

	* imap.c: Include Message-ID and Reply-To headers
	when fetching a message's headers from an IMAP
	server. (From: Andy Sloane <andude@incarnate.net>)

Tue Jul 21 07:54:03 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* recvattach.c:
	The old behaviour of the %d (for description) specifier is
	recreated by this patch.
	(From: Byrial Jensen <byrial@post3.tele.dk>)

	* protos.h, lib.c, attach.c:
	You should never _ever_ do something like this:

	       [process A]  ---[piped write until EOF]---> [process B]
	       [process A]  <---[piped read until EOF]--- [process B]

	Basically, what happens is something like this: A
	feeds data to B; B processes the data, and feeds it
	to the pipe until the pipe buffer is full; at this
	point, A writes to its pipe until its buffer is full
	too, and if it still has more data to write, that's
	it, it never gets to the read part to flush B's
	buffer --- both processes are blocked on write.

	This patch fixes such a situation in the compose menu.

	(From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

Mon Jul 20 21:01:05 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* reap.pl: Perl lies in /usr/bin on my machines.

	* pop.c: It seems that if you don't enter any
	password at all when prompted for the POP password,
	Mutt will die with a segmentation fault also. (Bug
	reported by Steve Mayer <smayer@rtd.com> via the
	Debian bug tracking system, fix from Thomas
	Roessler.)

	* postpone.c: When you send a message which have
	been postponed before sending, then all its
	attachments (if there are more than one) will have a
	content-disposition header which includes a
	filename, even if there isn't a real filename but
	only random choosen temporary one. (From: Byrial
	Jensen <byrial@post3.tele.dk>)

Sat Jul 18 09:18:31 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* recvattach.c: "Set mime_forward, and forward a
	message --- Mutt will segfault." The obvious fix for
	this is to check for aptr->content->hdr in
	mutt_attach_fmt() before invoking
	_mutt_make_string().  Anyway, I suspect that the
	real fix may involve something like parsing the
	rfc822 attachment in question.

	* sendlib.c: Postponing messages behaves funny when the $postponed
	folder is in Maildir format; I traced this down to the
	fact that postponed messages are saved in "cur" while
	mutt_num_postponed() is looking at "new".
	(From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>)

Fri Jul 17 08:37:02 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* compose.c: Removing the old snd_entry() code.

	* doc/manual.sgml, protos.h, pgp.c, mutt.h, init.h, hook.c:
	When sending encrypted messages, it may arrive that Mutt
	can't determine the PGP key of the recipient (presumably
	because her address has changed, but she hasn't updated
	her PGP key yet). In this situation it's convenient to be
	able to associate a keyID with an address automatically.
	The attached patch is an attempt to implement this idea
	using a "pgp-hook". (From: Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>).

	* recvattach.c: Removing the old attach_entry() code.

	* recvattach.c, protos.h, mutt.h, init.h, globals.h, compose.c:
	This patch adds a string variable $attach_format which
	controls the look of the compose and attach menus.
	Unfortunately, I was not able to make things so that it
	would look exactly the same as the hardcoded versions, so
	the default format is a bit different, but I think it is
	quite usable.  (From Michael Elkins <me@cs.hmc.edu>).

	* functions.h, browser.c, OPS:
	This patch allows you to view files from the browser
	window, useful if you are searching for a file to attach
	to your message. It uses the standard mailcap stuff (and
	the lookup mime types) to use the correct "viewer" for the
	file.  (From Brandon Long <blong@fiction.net>)

	* doc/Attic/dotlock.man.in, doc/Makefile.in, configure.in, configure, Makefile.in:
	Dotlock-related changes: We call it mutt.dotlock to avoid
	conflicts with certain NFS versions' dotlocking utilities
	(pointed out by Liviu Daia).  Additionally, we need to
	compile it as an external utility on systems which don't
	have an fchdir(2) system call.

Thu Jul 16 16:39:53 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* mx.c: Fixing a small typographic error.

	* mx.c: Mutt doesn't retry locking if it doesn't succeed at once.
	The code in mx_lock_file is supposed to retry but it
	doesn't work because of a mistake in operator precedence.
	(From: Petri Kaukasoina <kaukasoi@elektroni.ee.tut.fi>)

	* Attic/dotlock.c:
	The dotlock.c file tries to include <posix1_lim.h> if
	_POSIX_PATH_MAX isn't defined but it doesn't include
	<limits.h>, where this symbol should be defined.  (From
	Marc.Baudoin@solsoft.com)

	* send.c: When several messages are tagged and the user applies
	reply, group-reply, or list-reply to these messages, the
	reply's references and in-reply-to headers are constructed
	from the tagged message which comes last in the current
	index.  This patch constructs the references header from
	_all_ messages' message-id and references headers. (tlr)

	* reldate.h, configure.in, configure, Changes, ChangeLog:
	Preparing mutt 0.94.

	* imap.c: "My two remaining issues are the speed at which it
	downloads the headers, and support of PREAUTH. I'm
	enclosing a patch (to stock mutt-0.92.13i) which addresses
	these issues." (From Brian Marcotte
	<marcotte@panix7.panix.com>)

	* color.c: This patch fixes two problems reported on mutt-users.

	(1) the error message about "default colors not supported"
	when not using a color xterm should not be printed.  The
	existing code did not check the value of has_colors() in
	conjunction with use_default_colors()

	(2) mutt would crash when sending mail in batch mode
	because use_default_colors() could be used without doing
	an initscr()

	(From Michael Elkins.)

	* mx.h, mx.c, main.c, Attic/dotlock.h,
	Attic/dotlock.c, configure.in, configure,
	Makefile.in: Finalizing the external dotlock
	support: If group mail privileges are needed, the
	dotlock is compiled as a separate program.  If
	there is no need for privileges, it remains a
	module which is compiled into mutt. Also, there is
	no more need for the SLang buffer overflow
	work-around in main().  We drop it, but let mutt
	bail out instead if it's installed setgid
	something.

Mon Jul 13 10:50:39 1998  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@guug.de>

	* doc/mutt.sgml, doc/mutt.man, doc/Makefile.in:
	Since manual page generation seems to be broken in the
	SGML-tools package, we remove the SGML version of mutt.man
	and make the troff source the master copy.  Suggested by
	Roland Rosenfeld <roland@luv.rhein.de> who also provided
	the corrected mutt.man file.

Purpose
=======

This library provides an implementation of CRLF-terminated line-based client
protocols built on top of GIO.  It provides a base module, containing the
line-based IO methods, and on top of that POP3 (RFC1939) and SMTP (RFC5321)
client classes.


Coding Style
============

The implementation tries to follow the MISRA C:2012 (MISRA C3) and SEI CERT
Secure Coding standards for safer code.  For further details about these
standards, see
<https://www.misra.org.uk/Publications/tabid/57/Default.aspx> and
<https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/SEI+CERT+C+Coding+Standard>.


Requirements
============

Apart from GLib/GIO (at least version 2.40.0) it requires GnuTLS.


API Documentation
=================

Doxygen is required to create a HTML API documentation.  Install doxygen from
<http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html>.  Then run in this folder

	make doc

and open html/index.html.


Testing
=======

In the folder test, a test application for running unit tests, a check for
memory leaks and a coverage analysis is available.  The following packages
are required for running them:

- the Sput Unit Testing Framework for C/C++, available from
  <http://www.use-strict.de/sput-unit-testing/>
- ncat, available from <https://nmap.org/ncat/>
- screen, available from <https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/>
- sudo, available from <https://www.sudo.ws/>
- Valgrind, avilable from <http://valgrind.org/>
- LCOV and Genhtml, available from
  <http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php>
- gnutls-serv, which is a part of the GnuTLS package, available from
  <https://www.gnutls.org/>
- INetSim Internet Services Simulation Suite, available from
  <http://www.inetsim.org/>

Note that most of these requirements are typically available pre-packaged
for your favorite distribution.

Unfortunately, INetSim 1.2.6 has two little bugs in POP3 handling and does
not offer pipelining.  The file test/inetsim-1.2.6-POP3.diff contains a
patch which fixes these issues.

For running the tests, open two terminal windows, and cd to the test folder
of this package.

In the first terminal, call

	./start-test-env.sh

which will launch several dummy servers required for testing.  Note that
INetSim requires root permissions and is thus called via sudo.

Then, in the second terminal, call

	make tests

to build the test application, and run it in Valgrind.  Note that the test
application will report many CRITICAL glib errors.  This is normal, as the
behaviour of the library's parameter checks is verified.

The test produces the following output:
- stdout/stderr: unit test results, which shall report zero failed
- tests.vg: the output of the Valgrind memory check
- gcov/index.html: results of the coverage analysis

Finally, just terminate the test servers in the first window.  Note that
INetSim will dump further information in its output files (typically in
/var/log/inetsim).  You should verify that INetSim recorded the requested
operations properly.

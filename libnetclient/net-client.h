 *
 * This library provides an implementation of CRLF-terminated line-based client protocols built on top of GIO.  It provides a base
 * module (see file net-client.h), containing the line-based IO methods, and on top of that SMTP (RFC 5321) and POP3 (RFC 1939)
 * client classes (see files net-client-smtp.h and net-client-pop.h, respectively).  The file net-client-utils.h contains some
 * helper functions for authentication.
 *
 * The module net-client-siobuf.h implements some functions for replacing the @em siobuf in Balsa's libbalsa/imap module.

 * This module implements the base class for a simple network client communication on the basis of CRLF-terminated lines.
 *
 * @section signals Signals
 *
 * The following signals are implemented:
 *
 * - @anchor cert-pass cert-pass
 *   @code gchar *cert_pass(NetClient *client, char *cert_subject, gpointer user_data) @endcode The client certificate used
 *   for the connection has a password-protected key.  The certificate subject is passed to the signal handler, which shall
 *   return a newly allocated string containing the password.  The string is wiped and freed when it is not needed any more.
 * - @anchor cert-check cert-check
 *   @code gboolean check_cert(NetClient *client, GTlsCertificate *peer_cert, GTlsCertificateFlags errors, gpointer user_data)
 *   @endcode The server certificate is not trusted.  The received certificate and the errors which occurred during the check are
 *   passed to the signal handler.  The handler shall return TRUE to accept the certificate, or FALSE to reject it.
 * - @anchor auth auth
 *   @code gchar **get_auth(NetClient *client, NetClientAuthMode mode, gpointer user_data) @endcode Authentication is required by
 *   the remote server.  The signal handler shall return a NULL-terminated array of strings, containing the user name in the first
 *   and the password (mode @ref NET_CLIENT_AUTH_USER_PASS) or the OAuth2 access token (@ref NET_CLIENT_AUTH_OAUTH2) in the second
 *   element.  For @ref NET_CLIENT_AUTH_KERBEROS, no password is required.  In this case, the second element must be present in the
 *   reply, but it is ignored and should be NULL.  The strings are wiped and freed when they are not needed any more.

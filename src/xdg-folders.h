/** \brief Check if Balsa's files are stored in XDG-compliant folders
 *
 * \return TRUE iff Balsa's files are stored in XDG-compliant folders, if the migration was successful, or if Balsa is launched for
 *         the first time, FALSE if manual user intervention is required.
 *
 * The function can return FALSE iff a migration was attempted, but failed because either copying any files from the old to the new
 * location did not succeed, or if adjusting paths in the main config file failed.  In this very unlikely case, the newly created
 * XDG folders are erased, and manual user intervention is required.  The application shall be terminated in this case.
 *
 * A dialog is shown if a migration was attempted, both if it was successful or failed.

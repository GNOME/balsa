This is Balsa's website, spiced up with a bit of automation.

The files will be copied below whatever you specify $prefix
to be. Use --with-root to specify the HTML root, that is,
the text that is prepended to all links. An example root
would be "http://www.balsa.net".

A 'make' shouldn't even be necessary to construct the files,
but to keep them up-to-date you should do so.

A 'make install' will copy the files to $prefix. It is up 
to you to verify that links are working, etc.

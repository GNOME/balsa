<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>I see many compilation warnings. Is balsa broken?</p>
<blockquote>
It is really a problem with <samp>gcc</samp>. Upgrade <samp>gcc</samp> or
configure balsa with <kbd>--disable-more-warnings</kbd>.
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>Balsa refers some <samp>ldl</samp> libraries. What are they?</p>

<blockquote>
You need to install <samp>libtool</samp> package. Make sure it comes
with header files (or install respective <samp>devel</samp> package)
If you want to recompile balsa.
</blockquote>

<li><p>Does Balsa currently support IMAP?</p>
<blockquote>
Yes, although it is currently only in a preliminary state of support.
We support also CRAM-MD5 and GSS authorization methods.  Currently not
supported are features such as listing all IMAP folders on the server,
or subscribing to new folders on the server.
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>How do I configure IMAP?</p>
<blockquote>
Right click on a blank area of the mailbox list.&nbsp; Click
on add mailbox.&nbsp; Select IMAP, and click OK.&nbsp; From here simply
fill in the server name, user name, password, and folder name, and click
OK.&nbsp; Note that the folder name above is the name of the folder
that you wish to subscribe to.&nbsp; You will have to KNOW this in
advance, as Balsa cannot currently manage folders on the server.&nbsp;
If you are not sure what folders you have, try adding "INBOX"
for the first one, as this one always exists.&nbsp; :)
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>Does it have an address book?</p>

<blockquote>
Balsa will use your GnomeCard address book, if you have one, to read
and store contacts. It can also use LDAP to access a remote e-mail
directory.
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>Does it support filters?</p>
<blockquote>
Yes and no.&nbsp; To see the progress of filters on the GUI part you
must run ./configure with the option "--enable-all".&nbsp; This will
allow you to see the most current filter code.&nbsp; This code is not
in active development,&nbsp; but new filter tools are being worked on.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
On the other hand, the POP3 filtering backend based on
<samp>procmail</samp> is functional. When the respective POP3
'mailbox' has the 'filter' box checked, the downloaded mail is passed
on to procmail which will use ~/.procmailrc file as its configuration,
so you can share it between balsa and fetchmail and get consistent
behavior no matter you use balsa or fetchmail for downloading.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Simple example ~/.procmailrc file:
<pre>
:0H:
* ^Subject:.*balsa
mail/balsa-related-mail
</pre>
It is recommended to read <samp>procmail(1)</samp> and
<samp>procmailrc(1)</samp> for more real-life examples and syntax
explanation.
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Does it support file attachments?</p>
<blockquote>
Yes.&nbsp; Balsa does support attachments.&nbsp; You can drag files
from GNOME compliant file managers into the compose window as well as select
them from a file selection box.
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>How do I nest mailboxes?</p>
<blockquote>
Easy as pie. Just create a directory under your &quot;local mail
directory&quot;, then move your mailbox files inside it. (If you
move your inbox, outbox, sentbox, draftbox, or trash, you will
need to hack your .balsarc to reflect the changes. Simply search
and replace the old path to your mailbox with the new one.) In
the process of autodetecting your mailboxes Balsa will recurse into
the subdirectory and put the mailboxes in their own subdirectory.
</blockquote></li>


<li><p>How do I convert mailboxes from other formats?</p>
<blockquote>
Balsa can read many mailbox formats natively.
Have a look at <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-2000-11/lw-11-legacy.html">www.linuxworld.com page</a> for some details.

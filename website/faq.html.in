<p><big><big>Frequently Asked Questions</big></big></p>

<p>

1.&nbsp; Why does Balsa keep giving errors like "*** Syntax error on
line x in .balsarc"
<br>&nbsp;<blockquote>
The version of libPropList in CVS is incompatible with the
one in Balsa.&nbsp; Please delete {gnome-prefix}/lib/libProp* and then
install one from the <a href="@website_root@/download.html">download 
page</a>.&nbsp; This should not be an issue after version 0.6
</blockquote>

<p><br>2.&nbsp; Does Balsa currently support IMAP?
<br>&nbsp;<blockquote>
Yes, although it is currently only in a preliminary state of
support.&nbsp; Using the latest CVS versions of Balsa,&nbsp; it is possible
to access IMAP folders, and even drag mail from one folder to another.&nbsp;
Currently not supported are features such as listing all IMAP folders on
the server, or subscribing to new folders on the server.
</blockquote>

<p><br>3.&nbsp; How do I configure IMAP?
<br>&nbsp;<blockquote>
Right click on a blank area of the mailbox list.&nbsp; Click
on add mailbox.&nbsp; Select IMAP, and click OK.&nbsp; From here simply
fill in the server name, user name, password, and folder name, and click
OK.&nbsp; Note that the folder name above is the name of the folder
that you wish to subscribe to.&nbsp; You will have to KNOW this in
advance, as Balsa cannot currently manage folders on the server.&nbsp;
If you are not sure what folders you have, try adding "INBOX"
for the first one, as this one always exists.&nbsp; :)
</blockquote>

<p><br>4.&nbsp; Does it support POP3?
<br>&nbsp;<blockquote>
Yes, but this support is not entirely clear.&nbsp; You can specify 
POP3 servers to contact in the configuration,&nbsp; but
they will not appear in the mailbox list.
</blockquote>

<p><br>5.&nbsp; Does it have an address book?
<br>&nbsp;<blockquote>
Balsa will use your GnomeCard address book,&nbsp; if you have one,&nbsp;
to read contacts.&nbsp; This may not work if your GnomeCard is too old or too
new.&nbsp; Hopefully a more robust implementation will come soon,&nbsp; but Balsa
will never implement its own address book.
</blockquote>

<p><br>6.&nbsp; Does it support filters?
<br>&nbsp;<blockquote>
Yes and no.&nbsp; To see the progress of filters you must run
./configure with the option "--enable-all".&nbsp; This will allow you to see
the most current filter code.&nbsp; This code is not in active development,&nbsp;
but new filter tools are being worked on.
</blockquote>

<p><br>7.&nbsp; Does it support file attachments?
<br>&nbsp;<blockquote>
Yes.&nbsp; Balsa does support attachments.&nbsp; You can drag files
from GNOME compliant file managers into the compose window as well as select
them from a file selection box.
</blockquote>

<p><br>8.&nbsp; What about keyboard navigation?
<br>&nbsp;<blockquote>
Yes!&nbsp; You can easily navigate mailboxes and messages with only
the keyboard.
</blockquote>

<p><br>9.&nbsp; What's with the bug list?
<br>&nbsp;<blockquote>
The buglist currently is misconfigured,&nbsp; so the authors will not recieve
bug reports.&nbsp; Please send reports to <a href="mailto:balsa-list@gnome.org">the
Balsa mailing list</a>.

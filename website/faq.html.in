<p><big><big>Frequently Asked Questions</big></big></p>

<p>

1.&nbsp; Why does Balsa keep giving errors like "*** Syntax error on
line x in .balsarc"
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>The version of libPropList in CVS is incompatible with the
one in Balsa.&nbsp; Please delete {gnome-prefix}/lib/libProp* and then
install one from the <a href="@website_root@/download.html">download page</a>.</blockquote>

<p><br>2.&nbsp; Does Balsa currently support IMAP?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Yes, although it is currently only in a preliminary state of
support.&nbsp; Using the latest CVS versions of Balsa,&nbsp; it is possible
to access IMAP folders, and even drag mail from one folder to another.&nbsp;
Currently not supported are features such as listing all IMAP folders on
the server, or subscribing to new folders on the server.</blockquote>

<p><br>3.&nbsp; How do I configure IMAP?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Right click on a blank area of the mailbox list.&nbsp; Click
on add mailbox.&nbsp; Select IMAP, and click OK.&nbsp; From here simply
fill in the server name, user name, password, and folder name, and click
OK.&nbsp; Note that&nbsp; the folder name above is the name of the folder
that you wish to subscribe to.&nbsp; You will have to KNOW this&nbsp; in
advance, as Balsa cannot currently manage folders on the server.&nbsp;
If you are not sure what&nbsp; folders you&nbsp; have, try adding "Inbox"
for the first one, as this one always exists.&nbsp; :)</blockquote>

<p><br>4.&nbsp; Does it support POP3?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Yes, but this support is very crude.&nbsp; There are no progress
bars, and the downloading is not multithreaded.&nbsp; This means that balsa
will lock as the download is taking place, and will not be usable while
the download takes place.&nbsp; What is worse is that because the code
is still very preliminary, it may in fact BE crashed. This will be fixed
in a future release.</blockquote>

<p><br>5.&nbsp; Does it have an address book?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>No.&nbsp; The address book code from Gnome will be used via
a CORBA interface, but the code to implement this is just not ready yet.&nbsp;
When it is ready it will be implemented.</blockquote>

<p><br>6.&nbsp; Does it support filters?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Yes and no.  To see the progress of filters you must run
./configure with the option "--enable-all".&nbsp; This will allow you to see
the most current filter code.  Because filters are under heavy development by
<a href="mailto:jlbec@innerx.net">Joel Becker</a>.  If you would like to help
contribute code to filters, or give suggestions, please email him or
<a href="mailto:balsa-list@gnome.org">balsa-list@gnome.org</a>.  Filters do
not accually filter mail at the moment, but support is being worked
on.</blockquote>

<p><br>7.&nbsp; Does it support file attachments?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Yes.&nbsp;  Balsa does support attachments.  You can drag files
from GNOME compliant file managers into the compose window as well as select
them from a file selection box.</blockquote>

<p><br>8.&nbsp; Sometimes messages appear to have the last few lines chopped
off.&nbsp; Why is this?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>This is a known problem and is being worked on.  It has something
to do with the layout code not counting the scrollbar sizes into account when
it places the text.  This should be resolved in a future release.</blockquote>

<p><br>9.&nbsp; What about keyboard navigation?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>As the rest of Balsa, this is currently incomplete.&nbsp; Fixes
should be coming in future release, and patches are certainly welcome.</blockquote>

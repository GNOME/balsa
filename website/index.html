<dd>Secretly. Silently. Certainly. Yes, it is time for <a
href="download.html">balsa-1.2.0</a> release. There are no major changes 
compared to 1.2.pre3 but we have armoured the code against the 
unexpected.</dd>
</dl>

<dt>2001-08-31</dt>
<dd><a href="download.html">balsa-1.2.pre3</a> includes many fixes and 
has been tested on a larger variety of platforms.  This is most likely 
last release between 1.2.0. Anyway, if you had some problems with 1.2.pre2 
(or older), you should try this one to make sure that your problem has 
been solved.

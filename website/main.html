<!-- The summary -->

<p><b>Balsa</b> is a <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> email
client. It supports mbox, maildir, and mh local mailboxes, and IMAP4
and POP3 remote mailboxes. You can send mail via sendmail or
SMTP. Optional multithreading support allows for non-instrusive
retrieval and sending of mail. A finished GUI similar to that of <a
href="http://www.eudora.com">Eudora</a> lets you view images inline,
save message parts, view headers, add attachments, move messages,
print messages, and just about anything you would expect in a robust
mail client.

<p>
<ul>

<li>2001-08-31 - we release <a href="download.html">balsa-1.2.pre3</a>
that includes many fixes and has been tested on a larger variety of platforms.
This is most likely last release between 1.2.0. Anyway, if you had some problems with 1.2.pre2 (or older), you should try this one to make sure that your problem has been solved.
</li>

<li>2001-08-23 - balsa-1.2.pre1 turned out to be pretty stable but we
managed to nail down some extra problems and annoyances. Download
<a href="download.html"><b>balsa-1.2.pre2</b></a> from
the usual place.</li>

<li>2001-08-08 - it is time for a prerelease to next major version.
You can get <a href="download.html"><b>balsa-1.2.pre1</b></a> in
the usual place.</li>

<li>2001-07-13 - development balsa <a
href="download.html#dev"><b>1.1.7</b></a> released. This is most
likely last 1.1.x development release, we intend to start soon
preparation for 1.2.0 release. Several improvements in IMAP folder
handling has been done, new command line options have been added and
other UI improvements have been implemented.</li>

<li>2001-06-20 - development balsa 
<a href="download.html#dev"><b>1.1.6</b></a> released. The libESMTP code
has been tested, we added multiple identity code, improved usability
of large mailboxes and mailbox folders.</li>

<li>2001-05-22 - development balsa <a
href="download.html#dev"><b>1.1.5</b></a> released.  This is again
quite stable release, but brings some new solutions and requires one
extra package to install so please, make sure you have read the
instructions on the download page and the README file.</li>

<li>2001-04-20 - development balsa
<a href="download.html#dev"><b>1.1.4</b></a> released. 
This is actually quite stable one, with many bugs that were in 1.1.3 fixed
 - thanks to <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">Bugzilla</a> which helps 
us to organize stuff.</li>

<li>2001-03-29 - development balsa
<a href="download.html#dev"><b>1.1.3</b></a> released. 
This is mostly a bug fix release, including temporary file creation fix.</li>

<li>2001-03-02 - development balsa
<a href="download.html#dev"><b>1.1.2</b></a> released. The IMAP support 
is further improved in terms of stability. Multithreaded mailbox opening 
has been implemented.</li>

<li>2001-02-06 - development balsa
<a href="download.html#dev"><b>1.1.1</b></a> released! 
We spent much time on improving IMAP support which should be rock solid now.
You can also try IMAP folders to save your time defining folders on your
IMAP server (this is still a bit experimental, comments are welcome).</li>

<li>2001-01-22 - development balsa
<a href="download.html#dev"><b>1.1.0</b></a> released! This one
comes with rewrited mail alias support and is worth to get just for
this reason.</li>

<li>2000-12-18 - development balsa
<a href="download.html#dev"><b>1.0.1</b></a> released! This is just to make
 some bug fixes available as well as new threaded message index.</li>

<li>2000-11-11 - balsa <b>1.0</b> released! <a
href="download.html">Download it</a> and enjoy!</li>

<li>2000-11-03 - fifth and last 1.0 prerelease - <a
href="download.html">Balsa 1.0.pre5</a>. The final 1.0.0 release is
going to appear within 7 days and translations are the only part to be
updated in this time. Also, <b>read README</b>, we discovered that
balsa is sensitive to bugs in gnome libraries (and we want it to be
this way).
</li>
<li>2000-10-23 - fourth prerelease - 
<a href="download.html">Balsa 1.0.pre4</a>. pre3 wasn't really lucky, 
this one should be much better. Read README, we discovered that balsa is 
sensitive to bugs in gnome libraries (and we want it to be this way).
</li>
<li>2000-10-18 - third pre-release - 
<a href="download.html">Balsa 1.0.pre3</a>. Only minor fixes came in.
It is worth to upgrade in case you have problems with pre2.
</li>
<li>2000-10-06 - second pre-release - 
<a href="download.html">Balsa 1.0.pre2</a>. It has several bug fixes, most 
of them minor but still useful to have. It is worth to upgrade in any case.
</li>

<li>2000-09-29 - first pre-release - 
<a href="download.html">Balsa 1.0.pre1</a>. The version number has no
 particular meaning apart from 0.9+0.1=1.0. This release is supposed to be
stable code usable in the production environment (I use it every day).</li>

<li>2000-09-18 - not-quite experimental 
<a href="download.html">Balsa 0.9.5</a> - we are in feature-freeze state now.

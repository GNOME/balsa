<dd>Secretly. Silently. Certainly. Yes, it is time for <a

compared to 1.2.pre3 but we have armoured the code against the 
unexpected.</dd>

<dd><a href="download.html">balsa-1.2.pre3</a> includes many fixes and

last release between 1.2.0. Anyway, if you had some problems with 1.2.pre2

been solved.

README file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2001-04-20</dt>
<dd><a href="download.html#dev">development balsa 1.1.4</a>

in 1.1.3 fixed - thanks to <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">Bugzilla</a> 
which helps us to organize stuff.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2001-03-29</dt>

<dl>
<dt>2001-02-06</dt>
<dd><a href="download.html#dev">development balsa 1.1.1</a> 
released!  We spent much time on improving IMAP support which should be 
rock solid now.  You can also try IMAP folders to save your time defining 
folders on your IMAP server (this is still a bit experimental, comments 
are welcome).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2001-01-22</dt>

The final 1.0.0 release is going to appear within 7 days and translations 
are the only part to be updated in this time. Also, <b>read README</b>, we

it to be this way).</dd>

<dd>fourth prerelease - <a href="download.html">Balsa 1.0.pre4</a>. pre3

want it to be this way).</dd>

<dl>
<dt>2000-10-18</dt>
